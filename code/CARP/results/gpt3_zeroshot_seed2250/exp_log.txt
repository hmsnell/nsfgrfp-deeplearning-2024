Exosomes are a type of nano-sized extracellular vesicle (EV) naturally produced by cells and released via endosomal fusion with the plasma membrane. Although primarily utilized in the detection of diseases such as cancer, exosomes are increasingly being investigated as a means of drug delivery due to their potential for multi-functional targeting and inherent biocompatibility [1]. A longstanding setback in the study and application of exosomes for therapeutic purposes is the lack of standardized methods with which to isolate, concentrate, and characterize them [2]. Although scientists can functionalize exosomes with targeting molecules and drug payloads, scale-up is limited by the ability to quickly identify favorable processing conditions and thus good manufacturing practices. In this project, I propose creating a system that will reduce the burden of the screening process by developing a tool to rapidly assess exosome production and functionality. This study will help others engineer EVs as a tool for medical and non-medical applications. Traditional methods quantify exosomes via nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) which relies on light scattering of particles to judge size and concentration via analysis of Brownian motion. However, NTA also counts non-exosome particles such as protein aggregates, leading to large discrepancies in actual determination of exosome quantity in solution. Moreover, NTA does not account for functionality of engineered exosomes, which typically display targeting molecules on their surfaces. Current exosome purification methods are labor intensive, requiring multiple days of centrifugation and gradient separation to remove the crude EV material prior to quantification and analysis of the exosome product [2]. Therefore, developing a method to rapidly quantify and assess exosome functionality with targeting molecules would enable scientists to focus their attention on scaling up and purifying only the most promising therapeutic exosome processes. This development would bypass the current time-consuming roadblocks associated with engineered exosome production, advancing the field. Objective: I will establish a high-throughput method to screen processing conditions for engineered exosomes. Protein microarrays, which have previously been used in diagnostic exosome assays [3], have the potential to quantify functionalized exosomes in an efficient and accurate manner. Therefore, I hypothesize that protein microarrays can be utilized as a high-throughput method to screen processing conditions for engineered exosomes. I plan to (1) investigate optimal microarray conditions by engineering spot formulations and process steps and (2) evaluate ideal processing specifications for exosome production by running protein microarrays in tandem with cholesterol-based quantification standards. Aim 1: Investigate optimal microarray conditions to create a high-throughput screening tool for functionalized exosomes. Protein microarrays can be modified to include different antibodies in each spot. The ideal formulation would be one that binds only targeted exosomes. Exosomes express the surface ligands CD9, CD63, and CD81 as unique identifiers from other EVs [2,3]. Antibody cocktails for these ligands, as well as the expressed targeting molecules, would enable binding of only the desired exosomes— even in the presence of a crude EV sample—while washing away all other materials in solution. I will determine the concentration of each antibody for optimal exosome binding kinetics, which is a function of the desired targeting molecule antibody. The formulation must also be modified to include a solvent material that is suitable for microarray printing but that does not interfere with the antibody-exosome interactions. Once I find the ideal antibody cocktail ratios, I will test the formulation to ensure that it prints appropriately on the microarray slides. The solution’s fluid properties must enable it to flow easily for spotting on the slides, dry quickly, and spread evenly. Different additives noted in literature would be investigated to find those that work best with the solution. I expect that a 5% glycerol content will produce the desired results, as it was used in a previous publication illustrating a method for exosome phenotyping using protein microarrays [3]. Various factors affect microarray accuracy, including sample application times, wash and blocking buffer identities and concentrations, number and duration of washes, and drying times. Each of these factors will be explored systematically using a factorial design of experiments (Fig.1a). If the microarray cannot be optimized for EVs, a column-based affinity separation method could be used to purify and confirm functionalization of exosomes. Completion of this aim will optimize the microarray as a tool for engineered exosome analysis. Aim 2: Evaluate ideal process conditions for engineered exosome production. Having identified the most favorable microarray conditions, I will compare processing conditions for engineered exosomes to prove the rigor of the quantification method. With this high-throughput method, dozens of different processing specifications—such as days in culture, feed conditions, pH setpoints, and centrifugation steps—could be analyzed simultaneously with a minimal demand on sample volume. The first step in engineering a suitable high-throughput method is to create a reliable standard for comparison. While working at Codiak Biosciences, I pioneered a cholesterol assay that circumvented time-consuming NTA by quantifying exosomes based on their cholesterol content and presented a poster on this work at the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) 2020 Annual Meeting. The fluorescence plate-based Amplex Red Cholesterol Assay was quick and accurate within a prescribed range of 0-8 µg/mL. Employing it also enabled me to quantify exosomes without the need for purification, reducing cost and time spent. I will utilize this preliminary work to develop a standard method for exosome quantification for this project. Once the standard is established, exosome samples conjugated with fluorescent tags will be applied to the microarray spots. After washing, only the exosomes with the desired surface ligands will bind to the spot and be fluorometrically detected (Fig.1b). The relative fluorescence of each spot will be compared to a standard where only the exosome detecting antibodies, not the targeting molecule antibody, are present. This relative fluorescence describes the number of functionalized exosomes in the sample. These signals will be compared to the cholesterol-based assay to obtain a quantitative readout of the number of engineered exosomes and their relative protein loading. If fluorescent tags are not feasible, dyes, luminescent substrates, or other types of markers could be conjugated to the exosomes to create a measurable readout. The results of this aim will elucidate the ideal conditions for engineered exosome screening. Intellectual Merit: This work will generate a deeper understanding of protein microarrays as high- throughput screening tools and can be applied to development of new exosome or nanoparticle-based technologies, which could be used in applications ranging from drug delivery to water treatment. It will expand the foundational knowledge surrounding EVs and support future endeavors to optimize the production of different types of engineered exosomes, aiding in the discovery and development of EV therapies. As a member of the Leonard Lab, which has expertise in exosome production and engineering, I am well positioned to complete this project. Broader Impacts: This proposal integrates chemical engineering, bioengineering, and biochemistry principles to create an interdisciplinary project that advances dynamic drug delivery platforms through high-throughput screening. Successful completion of this project will enable accurate exosome quantification, reducing labor and time investments. Rapid identification of improved processing conditions will support efficient and sustainable production of therapeutic exosomes, increasing manufacturing feasibility, and thus increasing their eventual accessibility on a global scale. I will leverage my connections at Codiak Biosciences to establish a collaboration to facilitate and support the project. I will disseminate the knowledge gained from this research to the scientific community for feedback and further development through conferences and publications, such as the ISEV Annual Meeting. Providing students with opportunities to learn about STEM fields and to participate in projects directly will foster the next generation of research scientists. I plan to direct my outreach toward programs encouraging underrepresented students to consider graduate school, such as REUs and the Northwestern Morning Mentors and Mentorship Opportunities for Research Engagement (MORE) programs, where I will mentor students and encourage their participation in STEM research.

TDP-43 is also the primary component of cytoplasmic aggregates that are the hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease with very limited treatments and an average survival-after-diagnosis of 2-3 years.[2]Some of these aggregates are amyloid—aggregatescharacterized by a fibrillar morphology and β-sheet-rich structure as well as a prion-like ability to propagate the amyloid structure.[3]Amyloid proteins are closely linked to human disease, including many neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.

Phase-separated membraneless organelles have recently been discovered to play critical roles throughout the cell, but the complete composition and internal protein conformations of these droplets are not fully understood.[5]Long-lived SGs (the resultof prolonged cellular stress) have also been shown to lose fluidity and become proteinaceous aggregates, suggesting a connection between protein aggregation and phase-separation.[4]A link between LLPS and amyloid aggregation is likely, as many amyloidogenic proteins can phase-separate without the need of other proteins or RNA.[6]In fact, it has been shown that LLPS droplets made from the C-terminal domain (CTD) of TDP-43 act as an intermediate for amyloid aggregation in some conditions (Figure 1).[7] The study of protein conformation inside any LLPS droplet has been very limited.

Tissue engineering may help address issues of donor organ shortage and transplant rejection. However, applications have been limited by the ability to design complicated scaffolds that reproduce the architecture present in the cellular microenvironment. 3D bioprinting (3DBP) holds promise for addressing these shortcomings by producing biologically-inspired structures based upon computer-generated models. Unfortunately, low cell viability due to lack of nutrient transport through thick scaffolds is a current barrier to clinical use. Without blood vessels to facilitate nutrient and oxygen transport, cells at the center of the constructs die. There is an urgent need to improve methods such as 3DBP to develop implants to treat these patients. One method to address this problem involves artificial blood vessels created by physical channels through the scaffolds, seeding with endothelial cells, and adding growth factors. By this method, scaffold design must be further complicated by including vasculature. However, introducing oxygen-releasing polymers directly into the scaffolds may be a simpler way to address the need for oxygen transport.1 My research objective is to investigate the ability of oxygen-releasing microspheres to decrease cell necrosis for adipose-derived stem cells in printed implants. Using oxygen-releasing microspheres to reduce cell death rates for tissue engineering applications has only been referenced in one publication at the time of this application. This system involves a two level approach. First, core-shell microspheres are created with the shell consisting of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and the core containing H O -modified 2 2 poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP). This shell system allows for slow release of H O -modified-PVP 2 2 for up to two weeks.3 Second, the microspheres are then encapsulated in a hydrogel with catalase enzyme and cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs). Catalase reacts with the H O bound to PVP to 2 2 generate oxygen, which is then free for use by the cells. This system has been shown to eliminate significant CDC death.4 This promising result may also be replicable in other cell types. Among the most propitious lineages of adult stem cells are the adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) due to their ease of acquisition and ability to be chondrogenic, osteogenic, and adipogenic. Despite these advantages, ASC survival rates following in vivo implantation are low. Reduced viability may be due to lack of oxygen at the implant or inject site, which could be addressed by oxygen-releasing polymers.2 The steps involved in making a clinically relevant printed scaffold include material choice, cell type choice, printer type choice, scaffold material characterization, in vitro testing, preclinical animal testing, and clinical testing. Using this approach, I will complete the first six steps to adapt the PVA-H O system for use in 3DBP and test its ability to prevent necrosis in 2 2 adipose-derived stem cells using various hydrogel formulations. I hypothesize that using oxygen-releasing polymers will increase ASC viability in engineered tissue systems. To do this, I must address tissue engineering concerns such as refining 3D printing parameters, determining whether microsphere addition alters the mechanical properties of the gel, and selecting the gel type by printability and cell viability. 2 RESEARCH PLAN 2.1 Gel manufacture: For 3DBP applications, inks must solidify quickly, have appropriate mechanical properties, be non-immunogenic, and promote proliferation. Before manufacturing and encapsulating the microspheres, I will test several gel formulations including poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate to determine an appropriate method for 3DBP. Printability will be measured by the degree to which the print matched the design specifications by calculating the percent error of the printed scaffold compared to the 1 cm2 design. I will select the weight percent of each hydrogel by testing printability. 2.2 Manufacture of microspheres and gel encapsulation: To create the H O -modified 2 2 polymer, H O will be mixed with PVP in multiple molar ratios. The core-shell microspheres 2 2 will be electrosprayed using coaxial electrohydrodynamic atomization using a protocol described by Nie et al.3 Both the flow rate and voltages will need to be optimized to create particles of uniform size and morphology. I will use the previously determined weight percentage of hydrogel to encapsulate the ASCs, catalase, and microspheres. The optimum concentration of catalase will be determined by studying oxygen release kinetics in a hypoxic, acellular environment and measuring which concentration of enzyme sustains oxygen release for the longest time and at the highest levels. This will be determined over a 21-day period by using Ru(Ph Phen)Cl, a luminescent molecule sensitive to O concentration, while using rhodamine 2 3 2 2 b, a fluorescent molecule insensitive to O to correct for background absorbance. 2 2.3 Testing printed materials: Ensuring that scaffolds are safe for cells in vitro prior to further testing is essential. Cell viability in the scaffolds printed with H O /PVP will be tested in vitro in 2 2 a hypoxic environment using Live/Dead, MTS, DNA content, and IHC assays; they will then be compared to control scaffolds without microspheres and containing microspheres with no incorporated H O. Should cell mortality persist, I will attempt to adjust the gel porosity, printing 2 2 methods, and O release system to increase viability. If viability improves with the microspheres 2 in vitro, I will test their efficacy during a subcutaneous study in mice. 2.4 Timeline and Proposed Laboratory: To conduct this study, I would like to work in Dr. Warren Grayson’s lab at Johns Hopkins. Due to the close alignment of our research interests, when I met him at the BMES conference this year, he expressed considerable enthusiasm in working with me and funding my project should I be awarded the NSF GRFP. I anticipate this project to take five years: two for gel and microsphere manufacture and testing and three for in vitro and in vivo material studies. 3 INTELLECTUAL MERIT AND BROADER IMPACTS Currently, only Li et al. have used microspheres to deliver O to implant sites to prevent 2 cell morbidity. Instead, I will develop and test a rapid, accurate, and programmable method to fabricate these tissues using 3DBP. There have been no published papers that utilize microspheres, oxygen release, hydrogels, and 3DBP in conjunction to print biomaterials; integration of these techniques could greatly increase versatility of 3DBP in tissue engineering applications. As cell death is one of the primary concerns of tissue engineering in general and 3DBP specifically, finding a solution to this problem could advance the field from constructing thin tissue sections, to larger tissues, and eventually organs. Developing a standard method for incorporation of oxygen-releasing microspheres into a hydrogel-based printed scaffold is a novel approach that has potential applications in areas such as cardiac, bone, and cartilage tissue engineering. Osteoarthritis treatment is a particular challenge because of the hypoxic environment, but the H O -polymer complex can be a source 2 2 of oxygen for implanted stem cells while they heal the native tissue. Should this method prove effective, it could be used to encapsulate other materials such as growth factors or nutrients. To eventually reach clinical application, I will collaborate with surgeons at Johns Hopkins to develop materials that have clinical utility. Finally, I will present the results of my work at national and international conferences. [1]Camci-Unal, G., et al. (2013) Polym Int. [2]Tsuji, W., et al. (2014) World J Stem Cells.

Chronic stressors, including overfishing, coastal development, pollution, and ocean acidification, slowly degrade coral reefs by undermining vital ecological processes, such as grazing by reef fish and coral growth.3 Coral reefs are also threatened by acute stressors, such as cyclones and coral bleaching events, that may severely damage or restructure coral reef ecosystems.2,3 Climate change is predicted to compound these stressors and has already increased average ocean temperatures by 0.9°C globally.4 This increase has triggered three global bleaching events to date, and most coral reefs are projected to face annual bleaching by the 2050s.4 Adaptive and innovative management approaches are needed to ensure the longevity of coral reef communities in an era of global change.5 One potential approach supported by an emerging body of research3, 5-13 is resilience-based management (RBM).7 Under RBM, scientists and coral reef managers use a variety of biotic and abiotic indicators to assess coral reef resilience, where resilience is defined as the capacity of an ecosystem to resist and recover from stress without shifting to a less desirable ecosystem state.6 However, several knowledge gaps related to coral reef resilience hinder application of RBM theory.5-12 Scientists have not reached consensus on which biotic and abiotic indicators are the strongest drivers of coral reef resilience.6, 8 Most assessments of coral reef resilience are predictive, and few studies exist that test the accuracy of these predictions following major stress events.6, 13 Furthermore, these assessments are conducted across a range of geographies using varying methodologies, 5-12 which makes it difficult determine if observed variability in resilience is due to context-specific factors or broad biogeographic patterns. In addition, assessments of coral reef resilience are still evolving to incorporate emerging science on ecosystem thresholds and phase shifts between coral- and algal-dominated states.3, 11, 13 Proposed Research: The destructive 2014–2017 global bleaching event (Event), which impacted 51% of the world’s coral reefs,14 presents a unique opportunity to examine the impacts of major stress events on coral reef resilience. By evaluating changes in coral reef condition across an array of sites before, during, and after the Event, I will (1) assess the relative importance of select biotic and abiotic factors in determining coral reef resilience, (2) examine how the importance of these factors varies spatially among reefs in the central Pacific, and (3) ground-truth existing methods used to predict coral reef resilience. Experimental Design: An effective analysis of coral reef resistance to, and recovery from the Event will require extensive monitoring data that documents biotic and abiotic conditions on coral reefs before, during, and after the Event. As a graduate researcher at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography (SIO), I will be well positioned to access comprehensive monitoring data from past studies and collect data through current monitoring programs. To evaluate coral reef condition before the Event, I will analyze benthic and reef fish monitoring data collected as part of an extensive SIO study that monitored coral reefs across 56 islands in the central Pacific from 2002–2009.15 To assess coral reef resilience during and after the Event, I will analyze photo surveys and fish transect data collected as part of the 100 Island Challenge (Challenge), which is currently surveying 100 islands across a range of environmental and anthropogenic gradients in the Pacific and Caribbean.16 Photo surveys collected as part of the Challenge are orthoprojected to generate comprehensive 3D models of the coral reef benthos that document species composition and spatial arrangement to a resolution of 1cm2. The Challenge surveys sites (many of which were affected by the Event)14, 16 at regular intervals to document ecological changes, and has been monitoring numerous islands since 2013. I will select study sites by cross-referencing monitoring locations from the 2002–2009 study15 with locations currently being monitored by the Challenge (I anticipate this will reveal several dozen sites with sufficient monitoring data). I will evaluate the historic exposure of study sites to chronic stressors using the World Resources Institute’s Reefs at Risk spatial dataset of anthropogenic impacts.9 Similarly, I will evaluate historic exposure to acute stressors before the Event, and bleaching alert levels during the Event, using spatial data produced by NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch. Based on this evaluation, I will classify sites into eight experimental groups (Fig. 1). I will build off existing meta-analyses of RBM studies6, 12 to identify priority resilience indicators to measure, such as coral cover/diversity, herbivore biomass/diversity, coral recruitment, coral disease, macroalgae cover, bioerosion, substrate availability, and topographic complexity.3, 5-12 I will monitor these indicators as a member of the Challenge research team and extract relevant data from the 2002-2009 SIO monitoring dataset.15 Using this data, I will generate site-level averages for each indicator before the Event to determine baseline conditions and analyze indicator variance to assess pre-bleaching trends in ecosystem health. I will compare these values to indicator averages and variance after the Event to identify indicators with a statistically significant impact on coral reef resistance to and recovery from bleaching. I will also analyze spatial variability in site resilience to detect regional or context specific patterns (i.e., which indicators determine resilience and where), a knowledge gap prior studies have not addressed. Lastly, I will examine areas of overlap and divergence between my findings and those of prior resilience assessments. Fig. 1: Sites will be Anticipated Results: I hypothesize that reef resilience will vary classed into 8 groups based on past exposure. depending on each site’s history of chronic and acute stress exposure. In addition, I anticipate that the accuracy of resilience predictions and the relative importance of biotic and abiotic drivers of resilience will exhibit spatial variability at regional and local scales. Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts: This study will ground-truth RBM theory using empirical data to analyze patterns of coral reef resilience before, during, and after a major environmental disturbance. As a co-author of an RBM study,9 I recognize the potential of this research to address knowledge gaps, and thereby enable scientists to further refine RBM methods to reflect observed patterns of coral reef resilience. This continued refinement will be critical6 as reef managers, communities, and governments move to adopt RBM to inform marine protected area design, fisheries regulations, and other conservation measures7-10 that would have broad impacts for millions of people who depend on coral reef ecosystems.2 In addition, the methods outlined in this study could be modified to test RBM assumptions for other ecosystems threatened by climate change.7 As I conduct this research, I will use connections I have cultivated in the marine non-profit community by collaborating with researchers and practitioners, and draw from my communications experience as an environmental blogger to widely disseminate my findings.

As a result, research on increasing efficiency, reliability, and practicality of EVs and associated systems will be of increasing importance. Described herein is a wireless power transfer (WPT) approach for the dynamic charging of EVs. The goal is to address two challenges; reduction of component stress during high-power, high-frequency operation and electromagnetic field containment. Literature Review: Dynamic charging, also known as roadway charging, consists of embedded roadway coils that transfer power to receiving coils on vehicles in motion (see figure) and has been demonstrated to increase the range of EVs. However, power transfer levels of 50-100kW are required to maintain the EV battery state of charge while the vehicle is in motion [2]. Another challenge is the health implications of electromagnetic fields emanating from the coils. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) J2954 standard sets limits on stray electromagnetic fields [3]. Therefore, their reduction must be addressed if dynamic charging is to achieve mass adoption. Objectives: To develop a high efficiency, high power multi-coil WPT system that will allow for localized electromagnetic field production between source and receiving coils. Hypothesis: A reflexive WPT system comprised of: coils with embedded capacitors, saturable inductors and custom magnetic geometries, will enhance field containment capability and allow for efficient, high power dynamic EV charging with minimal electromagnetic field emissions. Research Plan: Stage I-Initial Investigations: A WPT testbed based on a reflexive field containment compensation approach [4] will be fabricated. This topology achieves field containment by exploiting the receiving coil’s reflected capacitive reactance to neutralize the source coil’s inductive reactance. The source coil’s current is thus attenuated when the coils are uncoupled, thereby reducing emanated fields. Based on my recent findings [5], saturable inductors will be used to enhance the field confinement effect. The goal of this stage is to achieve a power transfer of 10kW at an efficiency above 90% while maintaining a 30-fold field attenuation factor between uncoupled and coupled conditions. Stage II-Coil Embedded Capacitors: At power transfer levels of 50-100kW, the high voltages at the terminals of the inductor coils stress the resonant tank capacitors making the SAE J2954 mandated high frequency (~80KHz) operation challenging to implement. Previous studies have demonstrated this power transfer level only at lower frequencies [6]. Self resonant coils have been shown to eliminate the need for capacitors [7], however these are limited to use in MHz level resonant frequencies and lower powers. To address this, coil enclosures will be designed and built with polyethylene dielectrics spacers that allow for embedding large parasitic capacitances to reduce the voltage stress on the external resonant tank capacitors and allow for efficient high frequency operation. Stage III-Additive Manufacturing Based Magnetic Structures: Custom magnetic structures will be implemented in the coils to allow for optimum channeling of flux during operation to further reduce stray fields and improve coupling. This will be preceded by extensive finite element analysis of the desired magnetic structure geometry. The magnetic structures will be fabricated using an additive manufacturing process recently demonstrated at Oak Ridge National Laboratory [8]. A supplier for the required magnetic nano-alloy powder (FeNbSiCuB) and polyphenylene sulfide mixture has already been identified. Stage IV-Optimization: This stage will focus on the challenge of optimizing system performance at ~100kW for high efficiency operation, conformance to SAE standards and EV testing. Soft switching will be employed on the Silicon Carbide based inverter while processing minimal reactive power to improve efficiency. The test EV will be modified to carry the receiving coil and necessary power electronics to interface with its rechargeable batteries. Based on the SAE standards, shielding for the receiving coil will be designed to prevent fields from penetrating the EV cabin. An array of segmented source coils will be embedded on equal intervals of test track. As the EV drives along the track, the power transfer and field containment capability of the system will be characterized and compared to simulation figures. Timeline and Collaboration: The proposed duration of the project is three years and will be performed under the supervision of Dr. Srdjan Lukic at North Carolina State University’s (NCSU) NSF funded Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management Engineering Research Center (FREEDM ERC) in collaboration with Dr. Tim Horn of the Center for Additive Manufacturing and Logistics (CAMAL). Being one of the nation’s leading centers for additive manufacturing, CAMAL’s facilities have specialized equipment capable of fabricating magnetic structures from magnetic nano-alloy powders. The systems level integration will be performed on the EcoPRT EV mentioned in the personal statement. Anticipated Results: Through the use of saturable inductors, custom magnetic structures, and coil embedded capacitors, high frequency power transfer at 50-100kW power levels with high field attenuation factor between uncoupled and coupled conditions will be demonstrated. Noting that a WPT system is a transformer with a large air gap, this project strives to meet a theoretical system efficiency of 98+%, or comparable to plug-in charging. Intellectual Merit: This research plan focuses on developing novel WPT systems that enable dynamic charging and, more generally, on pushing the boundaries of high power WPT by developing better models of complex coil designs with integrated passives. Additive manufacturing will allow for novel magnetic structures that are optimized for specific applications, and this methodology can be utilized in other high power high frequency applications. Broader Impacts: The mass proliferation of EVs is essential in addressing both climate change and the dependence on fossil fuels. Through the implementation of WPT systems for EV roadway use, the proposed project will assist in making feasible a system that will allow for the efficient and reliable increase in range and thereby practicality of EVs. I will regularly present findings from this research effort at scientific conferences and high profile journals. With NCSU being located in the Research Triangle area, I will share findings with industry to facilitate industrial proliferation of the technology.

Stream water chemistry is thus an excellent indicator of broader critical zone (CZ) processes. The CZ is the space from the top of the vegetative canopy down to bedrock and lowest extent of freely circulating groundwater.1 The CZ framework provides a holistic approach to develop predictive models that describe processes at the earth’s surface, including the constraints on material export from the continents to fluvial networks.2 Concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships in streams provide an integrated signal of sources and transport processes to examine how solutes and sediment respond to changing patterns of runoff.3 Studies of the CZ are mostly limited to pristine systems; however, C-Q relationships in urban streams may be more complex due to altered hydrology, impaired water quality and heterogenous subcatchments.4 With increasing pressures on urban landscapes, there is an urgency to understand hydro-biogeochemical processes of the urban CZ that govern water quality and quantity. Research in urban systems will be highly valuable to cities and communities and can better inform management practices and help improve urban infrastructure.4 I propose to characterize and compare C-Q relationships across two stream networks with differing levels of urban development through a series of whole-network sampling efforts capturing baseflow to storm events. I also propose to study the impacts of hurricane disturbance on C-Q trends through analysis of long-term water chemistry records. I will test three hypotheses on variability in C-Q relationships across stream networks associated with watershed urbanization (H1-H3): H1: Watershed urbanization drives greater variability in C-Q relationships across stream networks associated with increased impervious surface area. H2: C-Q relationships during storm events are more variable in the urban network due to heterogenous hydrologic signals, and ultimately depend on storm intensity. H3: Both urban and pristine stream networks show increased variability in C-Q relationships after hurricane disturbance, but the magnitude of variability is higher in urban watersheds. Study sites: This work will be conducted in two watersheds: the urban Río Piedras in metropolitan San Juan, Puerto Rico and the mostly undeveloped Río Espíritu Santo in El Yunque National Forest in Río Grande, Puerto Rico, as a reference site. The Río Piedras flows through the metropolitan area with highly modified channels and significant impacts from failing sanitary infrastructure.5 In contrast, the Río Espiritu Santo originates in the Luquillo Mountains and is mostly undeveloped except on its coastal plain with significant changes in water chemistry evident only after hurricane impacts.6 The University of New Hampshire´s (UNH) Water Quality Analysis Lab (WQAL) group, including myself, has extensive experience working in these two stream networks. These watersheds are also a part of the Luquillo Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site and Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory (LCZO), which have generated multi-decadal records of stream chemistry and discharge. The lab also has ongoing collaborations with research groups at the University of Puerto Rico (UPR), who have worked in the Río Piedras: Jorge Ortiz- Zayas’s Tropical Limnology Lab and Alonso Ramírez’s Aquatic Ecology Lab. Proposed approach: (H1) I will establish a synoptic sampling regime of 20 sites in each stream network, ranging from small headwater sites to larger mainstem and coastal sites. I will collect water samples as well as measure physicochemical parameters with a handheld multiparameter instrument at least 15 times in the span of 2 years. Samples will be analyzed for nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, dissolved organic carbon, anions, cations, dissolved greenhouse gases, and total suspended solids (TSS) at the UNH WQAL Lab. I will also take discharge measurements at each 1 Carla López-Lloreda NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Graduate Research Plan Statement site and date either using dilution gauging or acoustic velocity measurements, depending on stream size. I will target sampling dates that capture a range of flow conditions by monitoring the US Geological Survey (USGS) gauging stations at two sites within each stream network. This sampling will allow me to characterize spatial and temporal variability in C-Q relationships across the stream network. (H2) I will conduct targeted storm sampling at one USGS gauged site in each stream network with ISCO automated samplers. These samples will be analyzed for the same solutes as in H1, with a focus on TSS to calculate sediment flux during storm events. Real-time discharge data for these events will be obtained online through the USGS´s National Water Information System Interface. I will capture events of different magnitude to explore effects of storm magnitude and intensity on C-Q relationships and solute and sediment transport. I will use these results to evaluate specific patterns of hysteresis, which characterize the rising and falling limbs of a storm event, providing additional insights into material reservoirs within watersheds. (H3) I will use long-term chemistry data from sites in the Río Piedras and the Río Espíritu Santo, which have been sampled weekly for approximately 10 years for multiple solutes and are USGS gauged sites. I will quantify C-Q relationships before and after Hurricane María in September of 2017 which will allow me to examine the resilience of these watersheds to a major perturbation. Intellectual Merit: This work will provide insight into the interactions and mechanisms of sediment and nutrient production, pathways, and transport in a tropical urban watershed. Studying storm events and hurricanes is particularly important because they are “hot moments” of increased hydrological activity, which transport disproportionate amounts of solutes and sediments to streams and oceans compared to baseflow conditions.7 Understanding high flow processes is crucial, as major storm events and hurricanes are expected to increase in intensity and frequency with climate change.8 And though much C-Q work has been done on temperate systems, tropical streams supply disproportionate amount of sediments and solutes to the ocean and studying these systems in a global context is becoming increasingly important.9 This work also leverages research done by the Luquillo LTER and LCZO research networks. Broader Impacts: During this work, I will continue developing collaborations with local research groups in ways that will engage local underrepresented undergraduate students in fieldwork through my network and storm sampling efforts. I will work with UPR professors to offer independent research opportunities to students. This research will provide a useful framework for local government agencies to use in their nutrient and sediment management plans across the island, including restoration projects aimed to help reduce pollution and sedimentation and regain critical zone services in urban ecosystems.7 For this, I will engage local researchers examining sediment and nutrient loading and the local Puerto Rico offices of the Department of Natural Resources. I will also collaborate with local organizations working in the Río Piedras such as the San Juan Bay Estuary and the ENLACE project of the Caño Martín Peña. These projects have longstanding efforts in the Río Piedras watershed and extensive connections with local communities. In collaboration with these organizations, I will use this opportunity to teach communities about water quality in their watershed through a series of roundtables and by providing educational resources to disadvantaged groups that have greater exposure to poor water quality.

Its intracellular lifecycle in amoeba, the natural host, has primed the bacteria for invasion into human alveolar macrophages. Co-evolution within amoeba and horizontal gene transfer has helped shape the near 300 effectors produced by Legionella that are injected into the host cell by the Dot/Icm type IVB translocation system1. A majority of these effectors have eukaryotic-like domains such as: F-box, U-box, Sel-1, ankyrin repeats, leucine- rich repeats, and CaaX motifs, which were likely acquired by horizontal gene transfer2. These domains aid in the hijacking of host processes by L. pneumophila in order to promote growth and replication. Many injected bacterial effectors are modified by the host through various post- translational modifications, however asparagine hydroxylation modification has never been observed. Post-translational asparagine hydroxylation of proteins in mammalian cells is mediated by Factor Inhibiting HIF (FIH). FIH is most commonly studied for its role in asparagine hydroxylation which regulates the Hypoxia inducing Factor (HIF), responsible for the transcription of around 100 hypoxia-related genes. FIH recognizes the amino acid sequence Lxxxx(D/E)ϕNϕ3. This motif can be found in 11 of the injected effectors of L. pneumophila, designated as Hydroxylated Effectors of Legionella (HEL). This motif can also be found in other injected bacterial effectors such as, the Outer Protein M (YopM) of Yersinia pestis, IpaH4.5 ubiquitin ligase of Shigella flexeneri, and an uncharacterized ankyrin protein of Rickettsia felis. It is likely that this motif is present in many other bacterial effectors that have yet to be described. Exploitation of host post-translational modification plays an important role in bacterial pathogenesis by further tuning it with the host, allowing it to manipulate and modulate host functions. Our hypothesis is that pathogens hijack host FIH in order to hydroxylate effector proteins, making them biologically functional. To test this hypothesis, three aims are proposed. Aim 1-Hydroxylation of effector proteins In order to determine if the HEL proteins of L. pneumophila, YopM of Y. pestis, and IpaH4.5 of S. flexeneri are hydroxylated in human cells, HEK293 cells will be transfected with plasmid containing FLAG-tag fusion proteins. Purified proteins will be analyzed by matrix- assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) Mass Spectrometry (MS), to identify a 16 dalton mass shift in the fragment containing the hydroxylation motif. This will be done in collaboration with Dr. Michael Merchant. To confirm the role of FIH in asparagine hydroxylation, FIH inhibitors and FIH silencing by RNAi will be utilized. We have tested and confirmed hydroxylation in this manner for one of the HEL proteins, AnkH. This gives us reason to believe that others may be hydroxylated as well and supports our reasoning for these studies. 1 Ashley Richards Dissertation Proposal 2013 Aim 2- Protein-protein interactions of FIH and effectors Our preliminary studies have shown colocalization of the host FIH and some of the HEL proteins to the Legionella containing vacuole (LCV). Therefore, interaction between FIH and effectors is likely to occur. Due to the transient enzymatic nature of interactions with FIH, Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) will be used to show the interaction between the proteins of interest and FIH. This system utilizes two plasmids each harboring half of a fluorescent molecule that emits light when brought together by interacting proteins fused to either half. If fluorescence can be detected by confocal microscopy in cells transfected with two plasmids, containing the N-terminal portion of the fluorescent molecule fused to either FIH or effector protein and the C-terminal portion of the fluorescent molecule fused to an effector protein or FIH, then interaction between of the two proteins can be suggested. Aim 3- Role of asparagine hydroxylation motif in the biological function of effectors Generating point-mutations in the asparagine of the hydroxylation motif for each protein will elucidate how hydroxylation of this residue is important to the function of the protein. This will be in comparison to the knock-out mutant, lacking the gene, which will also be generated. These mutants will be used in functional studies in a variety of species and cells such as human derived macrophages, mice, and amoebae. Because L. pneumophila has a plethora of hosts, it is possible that a mutant has an effect in one species or type of cell but not another. This will also be done with Y. pestis YopM mutant in human macrophage cell line, in collaboration with Yersinia researcher Dr. Matthew Lawrenz. Hydroxylation of bacterial proteins has never been shown before. This post-translational modification could be the key to more refined modulation and regulation of the host. This motif seems to be abundant in human pathogens and has implication in convergent evolution of bacterial effectors to better survive in its mammalian host. Not only will this educate us on bacterial host interactions but also provide more insight on FIH, as little is known about the nature of FIH hydroxylation outside of its role in hypoxia. Broader Impacts: These studies would lead into knowledge about effector proteins in the study with unknown function. Ultimately better understanding bacterial effectors and their role in the host could result in potential targets for novel treatments. My research will provide new insights into bacterial protein post-translational modification, and be added to publically accessible databases designed to predict protein structure and function. This will allow others to use this information to elucidate novel functions or regulatory mechanism for proteins in other species.

Keywords: Alzheimer’s Disease, Structural MRI (sMRI), Functional MRI (fMRI), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), GPU computing! Summary: I propose to use multiple imaging systems, such as structural and functional MRI imaging to provide a temporal evolution of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with multi-modal data. It will include patients that show no symptoms and patients that have MCI. This temporal evolution will show how different regions of the brain changes and how AD evolves. The hippocampus region will be a main region of interest, but other regions like the temporal lobe will be examined [2,3]. In addition with the imaging system, looking at the cerebrospinal fluid will provide great insight to how AD affects the body [1]. I will also incorporate GPU computing to make it efficient.! Motivation: AD is ranked as one of the leading diseases in increasing deaths. AD plans to increase among the world, which will have an effect on the economy. It is proposed that the expected cost of AD will rise to $1.2 trillion by 2050 [2]. Some methods have shown how some patients who have MCI evolve into AD [4]. If AD is not detected early, it will lead the patients to be in the latter stages of AD. The latter stages, such as stage 5 create severe cognitive decline and require the AD patient to need assistance in performing routine tasks [2]. Thus, detecting AD early is very crucial.! Hypothesis: Detecting AD in the early stages could be very beneficial to future patients, but has been a challenge. One group has said that validating imaging biomarkers for AD has brought controversial findings [5]. Now, using multi-modal data, such as fMRI, sMRI, and other imaging systems, could capture how AD progresses through time. With seeing different areas of the brain and CSF, it could provide insight to how AD evolves with patients that show no symptoms and patients that have MCI.! Research Strategy: To develop an extensive model of what makes AD develop between patients that show no symptoms at all and patients that have MCI.

Keywords: Alzheimer’s Disease, Structural MRI (sMRI), Functional MRI (fMRI), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), GPU computing ! Summary: I propose to use multiple imaging systems, such as structural and functional MRI imaging to provide a temporal evolution of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with multi-modal data. It will include patients that show no symptoms and patients that have MCI. This temporal evolution will show how different regions of the brain changes and how AD evolves. The hippocampus region will be a main region of interest, but other regions like the temporal lobe will be examined [2,3]. In addition with the imaging system, looking at the cerebrospinal fluid will provide great insight to how AD affects the body [1]. I will also incorporate GPU computing to make it efficient. ! Motivation: AD is ranked as one of the leading diseases in increasing deaths. AD plans to increase among the world, which will have an effect on the economy. It is proposed that the expected cost of AD will rise to $1.2 trillion by 2050 [2]. Some methods have shown how some patients who have MCI evolve into AD [4]. If AD is not detected early, it will lead the patients to be in the latter stages of AD. The latter stages, such as stage 5 create severe cognitive decline and require the AD patient to need assistance in performing routine tasks [2]. Thus, detecting AD early is very crucial. ! Hypothesis: Detecting AD in the early stages could be very beneficial to future patients, but has been a challenge. One group has said that validating imaging biomarkers for AD has brought controversial findings [5]. Now, using multi-modal data, such as fMRI, sMRI, and other imaging systems, could capture how AD progresses through time. With seeing different areas of the brain and CSF, it could provide insight to how AD evolves with patients that show no symptoms and patients that have MCI. ! Research Strategy: To develop an extensive model of what makes AD develop between patients that show no symptoms at all and patients that have MCI. Objective 1: Identify the critical parts/aspects that could lead to Alzheimer’s developing. Objective 2: Examine the different imaging systems that have been used to look for AD, such as fMRI, sMRI, PET, and etc. Objective 3: Extract the regions from the different imaging systems that show where AD could develop and run pattern recognition methods to classify which are likely to develop.

The majority of research regarding the signal function of visual traits has concerned color or patches of color. This focus on charismatic coloration has left unexplored the potential signaling function of achromatic patterns. Some patterns, such as the white check patch of great tits (Parus major) or the black facial spots of female paper wasps (Polistes dominula), have been suggested to function as assessment signals1. Yet, there is little empirical evidence that females consider patterns when selecting a mate. In the songbird family Estrildidae, patterns or certain features of patterns may be dimorphic, which suggests that these may be sexually selected traits. This idea is only beginning to be explored, with some studies linking estrildid patterns to individual quality2,3. Little is known, however, about how females perceive these signals, including the extent to which features that stand out to human observers draw the attention of the birds themselves. The zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) is an ideal species in which to study the role of achromatic patterns in estrildids. This species exhibits four notable sexually dichromatic traits, two being related to color and two being related to pattern. These include red beak color, which is more pronounced in males than females, and an orange cheek patch, barred bib, and white flank spots that are only exhibited by males. Although the function of male beak color has been well studied, little attention has been paid to the other three dimorphisms, aside from one study showing that female zebra finches prefer males with more symmetrical barred bibs5. There also is little known about how these dichromatic patterns have evolved, and to what extent these patterns vary in wild populations. Furthermore, zebra finches come from the subfamily Poephilinae6, which exhibit a wide range of chromatic and achromatic patterns, allowing for a tractable phylogenetic comparison of perceptual abilities. I hypothesize that dimorphic achromatic patterns function as signals of quality independent of color, and that species with these patterns are able to perceive and assess variation in this signal better than those without. Aim 1a: Quantify the range of natural variation of zebra finch patterns. Using museum specimens from the University of Michigan’s ornithology collection, I propose to measure the degree of variation of plumage patterns within zebra finches. After photographing the ventral and lateral sides of specimens, I will use ImageJ software to determine the degree of variation in male bar and spot pattern. This is an important analysis because in order for sexual selection to operate, there must be existing variation for it to act upon. After determining the range of this variation, I will categorize the types of plumage variation that may exist among males. Likely, these will include differences in regularity, contrast level, and density of patterns, though other features may also differ. Finally, I will test if certain aspects of these patterns covary with body size, beak color, or other indicators of individual quality. Aim 1b: Determine the extent to which females can discriminate natural pattern variation. Using methods developed to test for categorical color perception in this species (i.e. training birds to flip discs of different colors for a food reward)7-9, I propose to ask how female zebra finches perceive variation in patterns of bars and spots. To do this, I will make discs using paper printed with images of male chest or flank plumage as determined in Aim 1a. I will place these discs on wells in which a food reward is found and train birds to select the pattern that varies the most from the others. Using the range of variation determined in Aim 1a, I will test for the extent to which two varied patterns are indistinguishable to zebra finches. Given that zebra finches court at close range, this approach matches how close females would be to these patterns when assessing males. Additionally, I will test for sex differences in contrast perception to ask whether dichromatic bar/spot patterns could function in female choice, male competition, or both. If dichromatic patterns serve as signals of quality, I predict that female zebra finches will have the visual acuity necessary to discern variation in this signal. Aim 2: Test female preference for pattern quality. I will test for female preference of male pattern variants using digitally manipulated images of male conspecifics. Using a television screen separated by a partition (hereafter “Bird TV”), I will observe how long females spend near one of two videos of male zebra finches as evidence of their mate preference. I will first record videos of male zebra finches and then digitally alter certain aspects of their achromatic patterning that have been positively correlated with body condition and dominance hierarchy in other estrildids: regularity of barred plumage2 and number of white spots10, respectively. Bird TV, a novel method for mate choice experiments, is currently being developed by my advisor, Dr. Steve Nowicki, to test female preference for male beak color, which is a well-supported preference. After this approach is validated, Bird TV will be used in my proposed experiment. I predict that females will prefer the aforementioned pattern variants that have been previously suggested to serve as signals of quality (regularity of barred plumage and large spot size), but have not been explicitly tested. Aim 3: Compare the perceptual abilities of closely related estrildids: The zebra finch is a unique estrildid in that it simultaneously exhibits dimorphic carotenoid coloration, barred plumage, and spotted plumage. As a result, it is possible that zebra finches are adept at both color and contrast perception. Other closely related species, such as the long-tailed finch (Poephila acuticauda) or double-barred finch (Taeniopygia bichenovii), exhibit fewer dimorphic traits. Therefore, I will compare the visual abilities of zebra finches to its closest relatives to see if there are trade-offs associated with color and contrast perception. For example, the double-barred finch does not exhibit carotenoid coloration, but both males and females have bars and spots, and so may have been selected to specialize in perceiving patterns. In contrast, the long-tailed finch exhibits carotenoid coloration in both male and female beaks, but lacks bars or spots, suggesting that it may have been selected to specialize in color perception. I hypothesize that there is a trade-off between color and contrast perception—specifically, that exclusively colorful birds are better at color perception, and that exclusively patterned birds are better at contrast perception. I propose to test the color and contrast perception of the long-tailed finch and double-barred finch using the methods from Aim 1, then test female choice using methods from Aim 2, and compare these results to those of the zebra finch. An inconspicuously colored and more distant relative of the zebra finch, the Bengalese finch (Lonchura striata domestica), was recently shown to discriminate colors differently than zebra finches11. My work will follow up on this investigation to test the effect of phylogenetic relatedness on color and pattern perceptive abilities in Estrildids. Intellectual Merit: In studying the potential signaling function of certain visual traits, it is critically important to first understand how these signals are perceived. If such signals are not being perceived or differentiated at all, then we need to re-evaluate what other function they could possibly serve apart from intraspecific communication. While patterned plumage has been previously proposed to function in intraspecific signaling, no study has actually examined how adept animals are at perceiving variation in these patterns. Therefore, my work will be a necessary first step in determining if patterned plumage should continue to be explored as a signal of quality. Broader Impacts: As an NSF fellow, I will ensure that my research, at every stage, contributes to my personal goal of retaining as many students as possible in the sciences. At Duke, I will invite undergraduates to not only assist in collecting data, but also in contributing intellectually so that they may share authorship on future publications. During the summer, I will train undergraduates through Duke’s paid Biological Sciences Undergraduate Research Fellowship. This program not only introduces students to biological research, but also provides professional development opportunities and a campus-wide showcase to present their research. I benefited greatly from summer research programs like this, particularly the NSF REU, so I know firsthand the impact they can have. I want to help Duke undergraduates feel comfortable in a research environment through close mentorship and reassurance that questions and mistakes are part of the learning process. Beyond Duke, I plan to share my research with scientists and science enthusiasts in the broader “Triangle” (Durham. Raleigh, and Cary, NC) area. The North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in nearby Raleigh hosts opportunities for science communication and outreach that I plan to fully engage in. For one, they host the Scientific Research and Education Network (SciREN) Networking Event, which gives an opportunity for scientists to adapt their research into K-12 lesson plans. They also host a Darwin Day event, in which people of all ages are invited to learn about Darwin and his legacy. I will share my findings at these events, and adapt them so that they are appropriate and accessible to all ages and backgrounds. Finally, I will participate in Skype-a-Scientist to connect with students globally. 1Pérez-Rodríguez et al. 2017. Proc. Royal Soc. B. 2Marques et al. 2016. Roy. Soc.

Blocks will be designed to providepassiveerrorcorrectiononbothpickupandplacement,makingthesystemrobusttonoise fromlocalizationandcontrol. Localizationwillbeachievedwithspeciallydesignedinfrastructure partiallyembeddedintheblocksthemselvestoprovidecertaintynearassemblyareas. Underwater construction is both dangerous and expensive because specially trained human divers must build and maintain structures by hand. At moderate depths, extreme measures must be taken to protect divers including the use of hyperbaric chambers to treat decompression sick- ness. Small mistakes or equipment failures during a dive are disastrous, often resulting in death. Atextremedepthsbuildinginpersoniseffectivelyimpossibleduetothereducedcapacityofpres- surized air tanks at high pressure. The substantial cost and risk of using divers on site leads us to favor assembly on land and then transportation to the final location which constrains the types of structuresthatcanbebuilt. Though autonomous underwater construction technology could open a frontier of possible ap- plications, no autonomous system exists to date. Teleoperation based solutions have received at- tention in the literature including a rubble leveling robot [2] and a back hoe [1]. Teleoperation eliminates the need for accurate localization, but it requires that large amounts of data are passed back to the human operator at a high rate. Communication underwater is often achieved using either a physical tether or acoustic networking. Managing long tethers is difficult and acoustic communicationislowbandwidth,limitingthepossiblerangeofteleoperationbasedsolutions.

Research Question 1 How can we best exploit accurate localization information when it is avail- able, and smoothly switch to coarse grained techniques when it is not? Approach My preliminary experiments on localization suggest that sensor accuracy varies depending on the robot’s position and velocity. I will empirically model the noise and accuracy of the sensors under relevant cir- cumstances, then design a sensor fusion algorithm which exploits the most reliable information at every instant.

Frequent field tests in the athletic pool and nearby lakes such as Lake Sunapee will inform further iterations. Simple tests such as repeatedly moving a block back and forth on a platform in calm clear waters will help isolate the quality of localization data.

Rapidly deployable localization infrastructure will have applications in any autonomous robotic system attempting to achieve manipulation tasks in a remote or harsh environment.

INPUT: Introduction: Development of personalized medical treatments and diagnostics is limited by our ability to engineer tools that can keep up with demand. Exosomes are a type of nano-sized extracellular vesicle (EV) naturally produced by cells and released via endosomal fusion with the plasma membrane. Although primarily utilized in the detection of diseases such as cancer, exosomes are increasingly being investigated as a means of drug delivery due to their potential for multi-functional targeting and inherent biocompatibility [1]. A longstanding setback in the study and application of exosomes for therapeutic purposes is the lack of standardized methods with which to isolate, concentrate, and characterize them [2]. Although scientists can functionalize exosomes with targeting molecules and drug payloads, scale-up is limited by the ability to quickly identify favorable processing conditions and thus good manufacturing practices. In this project, I propose creating a system that will reduce the burden of the screening process by developing a tool to rapidly assess exosome production and functionality. This study will help others engineer EVs as a tool for medical and non-medical applications. Traditional methods quantify exosomes via nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) which relies on light scattering of particles to judge size and concentration via analysis of Brownian motion. However, NTA also counts non-exosome particles such as protein aggregates, leading to large discrepancies in actual determination of exosome quantity in solution. Moreover, NTA does not account for functionality of engineered exosomes, which typically display targeting molecules on their surfaces. Current exosome purification methods are labor intensive, requiring multiple days of centrifugation and gradient separation to remove the crude EV material prior to quantification and analysis of the exosome product [2]. Therefore, developing a method to rapidly quantify and assess exosome functionality with targeting molecules would enable scientists to focus their attention on scaling up and purifying only the most promising therapeutic exosome processes. This development would bypass the current time-consuming roadblocks associated with engineered exosome production, advancing the field. Objective: I will establish a high-throughput method to screen processing conditions for engineered exosomes. Protein microarrays, which have previously been used in diagnostic exosome assays [3], have the potential to quantify functionalized exosomes in an efficient and accurate manner. Therefore, I hypothesize that protein microarrays can be utilized as a high-throughput method to screen processing conditions for engineered exosomes. I plan to (1) investigate optimal microarray conditions by engineering spot formulations and process steps and (2) evaluate ideal processing specifications for exosome production by running protein microarrays in tandem with cholesterol-based quantification standards. Aim 1: Investigate optimal microarray conditions to create a high-throughput screening tool for functionalized exosomes. Protein microarrays can be modified to include different antibodies in each spot. The ideal formulation would be one that binds only targeted exosomes. Exosomes express the surface ligands CD9, CD63, and CD81 as unique identifiers from other EVs [2,3]. Antibody cocktails for these ligands, as well as the expressed targeting molecules, would enable binding of only the desired exosomes— even in the presence of a crude EV sample—while washing away all other materials in solution. I will determine the concentration of each antibody for optimal exosome binding kinetics, which is a function of the desired targeting molecule antibody. The formulation must also be modified to include a solvent material that is suitable for microarray printing but that does not interfere with the antibody-exosome interactions. Once I find the ideal antibody cocktail ratios, I will test the formulation to ensure that it prints appropriately on the microarray slides. The solution’s fluid properties must enable it to flow easily for spotting on the slides, dry quickly, and spread evenly. Different additives noted in literature would be investigated to find those that work best with the solution. I expect that a 5% glycerol content will produce the desired results, as it was used in a previous publication illustrating a method for exosome phenotyping using protein microarrays [3]. Various factors affect microarray accuracy, including sample application times, wash and blocking buffer identities and concentrations, number and duration of washes, and drying times. Each of these factors will be explored systematically using a factorial design of experiments (Fig.1a). If the microarray cannot be optimized for EVs, a column-based affinity separation method could be used to purify and confirm functionalization of exosomes. Completion of this aim will optimize the microarray as a tool for engineered exosome analysis. Aim 2: Evaluate ideal process conditions for engineered exosome production. Having identified the most favorable microarray conditions, I will compare processing conditions for engineered exosomes to prove the rigor of the quantification method. With this high-throughput method, dozens of different processing specifications—such as days in culture, feed conditions, pH setpoints, and centrifugation steps—could be analyzed simultaneously with a minimal demand on sample volume. The first step in engineering a suitable high-throughput method is to create a reliable standard for comparison. While working at Codiak Biosciences, I pioneered a cholesterol assay that circumvented time-consuming NTA by quantifying exosomes based on their cholesterol content and presented a poster on this work at the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) 2020 Annual Meeting. The fluorescence plate-based Amplex Red Cholesterol Assay was quick and accurate within a prescribed range of 0-8 µg/mL. Employing it also enabled me to quantify exosomes without the need for purification, reducing cost and time spent. I will utilize this preliminary work to develop a standard method for exosome quantification for this project. Once the standard is established, exosome samples conjugated with fluorescent tags will be applied to the microarray spots. After washing, only the exosomes with the desired surface ligands will bind to the spot and be fluorometrically detected (Fig.1b). The relative fluorescence of each spot will be compared to a standard where only the exosome detecting antibodies, not the targeting molecule antibody, are present. This relative fluorescence describes the number of functionalized exosomes in the sample. These signals will be compared to the cholesterol-based assay to obtain a quantitative readout of the number of engineered exosomes and their relative protein loading. If fluorescent tags are not feasible, dyes, luminescent substrates, or other types of markers could be conjugated to the exosomes to create a measurable readout. The results of this aim will elucidate the ideal conditions for engineered exosome screening. Intellectual Merit: This work will generate a deeper understanding of protein microarrays as high- throughput screening tools and can be applied to development of new exosome or nanoparticle-based technologies, which could be used in applications ranging from drug delivery to water treatment. It will expand the foundational knowledge surrounding EVs and support future endeavors to optimize the production of different types of engineered exosomes, aiding in the discovery and development of EV therapies. As a member of the Leonard Lab, which has expertise in exosome production and engineering, I am well positioned to complete this project. Broader Impacts: This proposal integrates chemical engineering, bioengineering, and biochemistry principles to create an interdisciplinary project that advances dynamic drug delivery platforms through high-throughput screening. Successful completion of this project will enable accurate exosome quantification, reducing labor and time investments. Rapid identification of improved processing conditions will support efficient and sustainable production of therapeutic exosomes, increasing manufacturing feasibility, and thus increasing their eventual accessibility on a global scale. I will leverage my connections at Codiak Biosciences to establish a collaboration to facilitate and support the project. I will disseminate the knowledge gained from this research to the scientific community for feedback and further development through conferences and publications, such as the ISEV Annual Meeting. Providing students with opportunities to learn about STEM fields and to participate in projects directly will foster the next generation of research scientists. I plan to direct my outreach toward programs encouraging underrepresented students to consider graduate school, such as REUs and the Northwestern Morning Mentors and Mentorship Opportunities for Research Engagement (MORE) programs, where I will mentor students and encourage their participation in STEM research.

INPUT: conserved protein belonging to the ribonuclear binding protein family.[1]It is involved in diverse, essential cellular functions including RNA transport and alternative splicing. TDP-43 is also the primary component of cytoplasmic aggregates that are the hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease with very limited treatments and an average survival-after-diagnosis of 2-3 years.[2]Some of these aggregates are amyloid—aggregatescharacterized by a fibrillar morphology and β-sheet-rich structure as well as a prion-like ability to propagate the amyloid structure.[3]Amyloid proteins are closely linked to human disease, including many neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. One role TDP-43 performs in the cytoplasm is protecting RNA during cellular stress by forming membraneless organelles known as stress granules (SGs).[4]SGsare concentrated droplets of RNA and RNA-binding proteins that are formedvialiquid-liquid phase-separation(LLPS), the spontaneous de mixing of a solution into a metastable concentrated droplet phase and a dilute phase driven by transient, multivalent interactions. Phase-separated membraneless organelles have recently been discovered to play critical roles throughout the cell, but the complete composition and internal protein conformations of these droplets are not fully understood.[5]Long-lived SGs (the resultof prolonged cellular stress) have also been shown to lose fluidity and become proteinaceous aggregates, suggesting a connection between protein aggregation and phase-separation.[4]A link between LLPS and amyloid aggregation is likely, as many amyloidogenic proteins can phase-separate without the need of other proteins or RNA.[6]In fact, it has been shown that LLPS droplets made from the C-terminal domain (CTD) of TDP-43 act as an intermediate for amyloid aggregation in some conditions (Figure 1).[7] The study of protein conformation inside any LLPS droplet has been very limited. Better understanding of the basic composition of droplets (i.e. water content) as well as the secondary structure of protein in LLPS droplets will help Figure characterize how it may serve as an aggregation 1. intermediate. Investigating whether either of these TDP-43factors change with droplet age will add further to states. the story. For example, is droplet aging and TDP-43 in (a) soluble (b) phase-separated, and accompanying loss of droplet fluidity due to CTD (c) aggregated states as viewed by brightfield changes in protein conformation, water confocal microscopy. Scale bars are 10 µm. exclusion,oranotherfactor?Doessecondarystructureofconstituentproteinschangeasdropletsage,ordo proteins remain disordered throughout droplet lifetime? Do aggregates formed via a phase-separation intermediate differ substantially from those formed in non-phase-separating conditions? Being able to address these questions will help 1) better understand LLPS and how itcarriesoutitsmanycellularroles, and 2) identify possible drug targets if TDP-43 LLPS proves to be linked to pathological amyloid aggregation. This work aims to understand secondarystructureofTDP-43inphase-separateddropletsand track changes that may occur in droplet hydration and protein conformation during the transition from LLPS to aggregate. Methods and Experimental Design. I propose to utilize Ramanmicro-spectroscopy—asensitivetypeof vibrational spectroscopy which utilizes Raman scattering—coupled to a microscope, which allows for spatial resolution (Figure 2a).[8] Water scatters strongly in the 3000–3600 cm−1 range, allowing for an approximation of hydration in droplets based on the intensity of the water bands versus a standard. The Raman fingerprint region (1000–2000 cm−1) informsonthesecondarystructureoftheprotein(Figure2b). Specifically, the formation of β-sheet-rich structures upon amyloid aggregation results in a characteristic peak at ~1665 cm−1.[9]Sidechain packing can be analyzedviaC-H deformation modes at 1300-1500 cm−1.[9]One of the strengths of Raman spectroscopyis that a single droplet can be observed over time with Raman spectra taken at multiple time points. Raman data from Murthyet al.of another phase-separated amyloid protein similar to TDP-43 suggests that protein within the droplets resembles soluble protein at early time points, but it is unknown if this structure is sustainable or if it naturally proceeds to a more amyloid-like secondary structure.[10]By followingthe lifetime of TDP-43 droplets, I can determine changes in hydration and protein structure as the droplets age and lose fluidity, filling the gaps left by Murthyet al.and expanding the work to a proteinmore relevant to ALS pathology. Aim One: Collect Raman spectra inside of LLPS can act as a mechanistic intermediate during TDP-43 LLPS droplets TDP-43 amyloid formation. TDP-43 will be used to prototype the experiment Aim Two: Characterize Differences between CTD because it reliably forms β-sheet-rich amyloid, and I Aggregates have previously characterized its aggregation Figure 2. Raman spectroscopy kinetics in a variety of conditions. TDP 43 can CTD phase-separate on its own and has been reported to drive aggregation of the full-length protein.[11]After proof-of-concept, full-length TDP-43 will be expressed and purified. The protein will be placed in phase-separating solution conditions (high salt, neutral pH), and phase-separation will be confirmed viabrightfield microscopy (Figure 1b). I will create a catalog of Raman data from each time point giving a detailed view of the structural changes during droplet solidification. I hypothesize that: 1) the conformation of TDP-43 will differ between its soluble, LLPS, and aggregated forms, 2) water content in droplets will (a) Diagram decrease as droplets age and water becomes excluded illustrating the set-up of a Raman microscope, from the stacked β-sheets formed by proteins in the adapted from [12] (b) Representative Raman amyloid conformation, and 3) as the phase-separated spectra of TDP-43 fibrils with evident C-H droplet ages, the secondary structure band around CTD deformations an amide I band reporting on β-sheet 1600-1700 cm-1will narrow and sharpen, indicatinga content. transition to β-sheet that mimics amyloid aggregates. Taken together, this data would demonstrate that TDP-43 can aggregate even when phase-separation is not present. I will use Raman spectroscopy to analyze the secondary structure of aggregates formed with and without the phase-separation. This will reveal any polymorphism in structure as Raman spectra are sensitive to not just secondary structure, but also side chain packing as seen in the C-H deformation bands. I will also use Raman to examine samples propagated from the brains of ALS patients (patient samples are used to ‘seed’ recombinant protein and, due to the prion-like nature of TDP-43, structure is preserved). By comparing the Raman spectrum of the in vitrophase-separated and non-phase-separated aggregatesto the spectra of the patient-propagated samples, insight into whether disease-related aggregation stems from a phase-separated intermediate will be gained.Resources and Suitability.I have significantexperience using Raman micro-spectroscopy in Dr. Jennifer Lee’s lab at the NIH. Paired with my prior work with TDP-43 and strong record of independence and publication, this makes me uniquely well-suited to pursue this project. The work will be conducted utilizing the Raman micro-spectrometer at the University of Wisconsin Centers for Nanoscale Technology. Intellectual Merit.By characterizing the generalhydration and composition of LLPS droplets, this project will provide foundational information on LLPS, a process of interest to fields ranging from polymer chemistry to cell biology. Additionally, if LLPS are shown to be intermediates in amyloid aggregation, this opens new doorways for drug development targeting the proteins in droplets. Broader Impacts. This project illustrates the value of an interdisciplinary approach in studying human health and disease processes. Specifically, it demonstrates how physical chemistry methods—the most micro scale—can offer foundational, useful information on emergent processes in complex biological systems. I hope that demonstrating the utility of physical chemistry, which can often feel hopelessly far removed and theoretical for students, will pique the interest of the next generation of chemists as I work with them as a teaching assistant and research mentor.

Figure 3. Overall flow of this proposed method.

This proposed method was evaluated on 20 research proposals (10 winners and 10 honorable mentions) submitted to the NSF GRFP 2017-2018. The evaluation was done by two independent human evaluators (a tenured professor and a postdoctoral fellow). The human evaluators were asked to score each input as Winner or Honorable Mention. The results of this proposed method (i.e., Winner and Honorable Mention scores) were compared with the human evaluator’s score and the accuracy rate was calculated. Table 1 shows the overall accuracy rate of this proposed method, which is 85% (17/20).

2024-05-06 12:58:12 - GPT3-Text-Classification : - INFO: returned results - Recently, the search for key words in research papers has become increasingly popular. Instead of searching for all the key words a paper uses, this system classifies key words into several categories. A new key word is assigned to a category when it occurs in a text with other key words in the same category. This paper introduces a simple system for key word classification. Our system is based on a recent paper by C. Macdonald et al. [1], and a new system for key word classification is presented. One of the main differences between our new system and the original system is that our system uses a single key word, rather than a list of key words, as input. Since our system uses a single key word instead of a list of key words, our system can be applied to larger bodies of text. Since our system uses multiple categories in classification, our system can also be applied to large bodies of text. The overall system is a simple classifier and it performs well for key word classification

with specially designed infrastructure partially embedded in the blocks themselves to
provide certain n to assembly areas. Underwater construction is both dangerous and
expensive because specially trained human divers must build and maintain structures
by hand. At moderate depths, extreme measures must be taken to protect divers in-
cluding the use of hyperbaric chambers to treat decompression sickness. Small mis-
takes or equipment failures during a dive are disastrous, often resulting in death. At
extreme depths building in person is effectively impossible due to the reduced capacity
of pressurized air tanks at high pressure. The substantial

Active learning for multimodal data: A review and comparison of machine learning methods
Active learning is a well-known technique for reducing the amount of labeled data needed to train a machine learning model, and has been used in a variety of application domains. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of active learning methods that have been used in the context of multimodal data. We discuss the specific characteristics of multimodal data and present the differences between different applications of active learning in multimodal data, including semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and multimodal fusion. We also discuss the importance of incorporating model uncertainty in active learning, and present a review of active learning methods that incorporate uncertainties, including sample selection methods and weighted methods. We also present a review of active learning methods that can be used for multimodal fusion and semi

This is the output:

The file used is here.

What I want to do is to use some keywords that I have written in the beginning of the file to show some information at the end of the file, and also to tell if it is correct or wrong. This information will be shown in the output. How can I do that? What is the best way to do that?

Any help is very appreciated. Thank you.

Edited on 09/10/2021: I want to use the keywords in keywords.tex file, to detect the errors in the main file. The keywords file is like this:

The human lifespan is the longest in the animal kingdom, with the oldest known individual living to be 122 years old. This extraordinary longevity is accompanied by an extremely high degree of individual variation in lifespan. Despite the discovery of hundreds of loci associated with human longevity, the mechanisms underlying this extraordinary evolutionary success story remain poorly understood. Very little is known about the behavioral, neurobiological, and genetic mechanisms underlying human longevity, despite their importance to human health. In particular, no studies have determined what behavioral and neurobiological states lead to individual differences in human lifespan. We propose to investigate lifespan variation in humans using a unique population of supercentenarians (individuals over 110 years of age) and long-lived (>105 years of age) centenarians. We will determine the behavioral, neurobiological, and genetic mechanisms underlying human longevity

Evaluation of a Model to Predict Metastasis Using Machine Learning and Neural Networks

Subodh K. Nigam and Omid Kavehei, Computer Science and Engineering, The University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019, USA

Abstract: The objective of this study is to develop and use a model to predict metastasis of breast cancer using a machine learning algorithm and neural networks. The objective is to predict the probability of survival and the probability of metastasis based on the data provided to the model. The study is significant because it will develop a model that can predict metastasis of breast cancer. The model will be used to predict metastasis of breast cancer among the patients who have undergone the reconstructive surgery. The model will be used to predict the probability of survival of the patients who have undergone the reconstructive surgery. The

The results of the experiment were as follows. I have proposed a new method of classification of the success of the research proposal. In this method, I used the research proposal submitted to NSF GRFP as the input, and the success of the research proposal as the output. In order to determine the success of the research proposal, three steps were taken. First, I listed the clues that can be used to determine whether the research proposal is successful or not. This list of clues is called the Hidden Reference (HR) and was obtained by analyzing the text of the research proposal. Second, I researched and identified the reasons to determine the success of the research proposal. The identified reasons are called the Reasoning Process (RP). Third, I developed a diagnostic reasoning process that uses the HR and the RP to determine the success of the research proposal. The overall success of the research proposal was determined by using the diagnostic reasoning process and the information contained in the HR and RP. The diagnostic reasoning process

Therefore, I hypothesize that protein microarrays can be utilized as a high-throughput method to screen processing conditions for engineered exosomes. I plan to (1) investigate optimal microarray conditions by engineering spot formulations and process steps and (2) evaluate ideal processing specifications for exosome production by running protein microarrays in tandem with cholesterol-based quantification standards.

Aim 1: Investigate optimal microarray conditions to create a high-throughput screening tool for functionalized exosomes. Protein microarrays can be modified to include different antibodies in each spot. The ideal formulation would be one that binds only targeted exosomes. Exosomes express the surface ligands CD9, CD63, and CD81 as unique identifiers from other EVs [2,3

Protein Microarray Assays for High-Throughput Screening of Engineered Exosomes

Abstract

The exosome is a type of extracellular vesicle (EV) that is naturally released by cells. Engineered exosomes are being investigated as a means of drug delivery due to their potential for multi-functional targeting and inherent biocompatibility. Although scientists can functionalize exosomes with targeting molecules and drug payloads, scale-up is limited by the ability to quickly identify favorable processing conditions and thus good manufacturing practices. In this project, we developed a system that will reduce the burden of the screening process by developing a tool to rapidly assess exosome production and functionality.

The Role of the Third Wave of Social Movement in the Environmental Movement

- View Presentation - View Poster

Abstract

The third wave of social movement is the study of social movements that are highly organized, technologically driven, and innovative in their approaches. These movements are differentiated from the first and second waves of social movements which were characterized by grassroots organizing and the use of more traditional forms of organization. In this research, I use a social movement perspective to examine the environmental movement and its use of social media in the third wave. The environmental movement is a social movement that has grown to encompass millions of people and organizations around the world. The environmental movement has been characterized as a social movement that has moved through the first and second waves and is now in the third wave. However, it is also a movement that has been highly criticized by many scholars. The environmental movement is also highly debated by scholars, especially about

As discussed in the introduction, the dataset contains research proposals, their keywords and metadata. The goal is to determine the overall SUCCESS of INPUT. The INPUT is the research proposal itself, the CLUES are the keywords of the INPUT and the REASONING process is the chain of reasoning among the CLUES and the INPUT.

The output of the algorithm is defined as two outputs, namely, Winner and Honorable Mention.

The first step for this algorithm is to generate CLUES. In this case, CLUES are keywords and phrases. The second step is for the algorithm to induce a diagnostic REASONING process from CLUES and the INPUT. In this case, the DIAGNOSE process is to determine the overall SUCCESS of INPUT. The third step is to determine the overall SUCCESS of INPUT as Winner or Honorable Mention considering CLUES, the DIAGNOSE process and the INPUT.

For the DIAGNOSE process, we first identified the key terms in the INPUT and the CLUES. After

I am not sure what you are trying to do with the \begin{document} and \end{document}, but it seems like you are over-complicating things. You can just use \begin{document} and \end{document} on their own, and you probably don't need to be using LaTeX2e syntax. – Alan Munn Nov 22 '18 at 17:07

     

I think the idea is that this is a kind of latex file to be compiled for submission to the competition. So a full latex file with the \documentclass and everything, which is then compiled with pdflatex. – moewe Nov 22 '18 at 17:09

The COVID-19 data set is a classification task of text data with 60,000 documents and 15,000 examples. The COVID-19 data set is a medical text classification task with 60,000 documents and 15,000 examples. The goal is to predict whether each document is about COVID-19 or not. The authors provide the COVID-19 data set in 3 different formats: 1) raw text, 2) XML, and 3) JSON. The raw text format of the COVID-19 data set is about 12GB of data, the XML format is about 6GB of data, and the JSON format is about 2GB of data. The following is an example of the raw text format of the COVID-19 data set.

\section{Data and Preprocessing}

\subsection{Data}
The data used for this task is the NSF GRF dataset which contains 5,000 research proposals submitted to NSF GRF applications and 10,000 research proposals that are not submitted to NSF GRF applications. The data is labeled as either Winner or Honorable Mention which is used as the overall success classifier. Our data for the analysis is composed of the following: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Research proposals submitted to NSF GRF applications.
\item Research proposals that are not submitted to NSF GRF applications.
\item CLUES extracted from the research proposals.
\item The overall success classifier which is Winner or Honorable Mention.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Preprocessing}
The data is processed to be in a form that is easier to analyze. The process of preprocessing is as follows:

The commands to use depend on the style you are using. If you are using the author-year style, you will use \citet, or \citeauthor, and if you are using the numeric style, you will use \citep, or \citeyearpar. – Alan Munn May 18 '12 at 21:49

This funding has enabled researchers to make significant progress in a wide variety of research areas. However, the economy has recently slowed, and the funding available to Canadian researchers has declined. This has had a significant impact on researchers in Canada, who are now required to apply for funding more frequently. This increased competition is stressful and may lead to decreased productivity. However, with appropriate support, researchers may be able to increase their productivity. In order to achieve this, it is important that their funding applications are written in a manner that maximizes their chances of success. The purpose of this project is to develop and evaluate a scientific writing support tool that can be used to assist researchers in producing funding applications.

In its active, infectious form, TB is a devastating disease: it kills 1.5 million per year and infects many more. The development of new antibiotics has been impeded by the lack of understanding of how the most virulent TB strains grow and survive. My research aims to understand how these bacteria grow and survive in order to design new drugs to treat TB. I will study the interaction of the bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with the immune system of the host in order to understand how the bacteria evade the immune response. The immune system is a key component of defense against the bacteria. However, the bacteria are able to evade the immune response by forming a biofilm, which is a community of bacteria that adhere to one another and to a surface. This biofilm protects the bacteria from the immune system and makes the bacteria more resistant to antibiotics. My research is focused on understanding

Abstract. The Benthic Community (BC) of coral reefs is the primary habitat for many of the organisms living in the ocean. The BC is made up of the corals, sponges, algae and other invertebrates and fishes. This paper looks at the coral reef dynamics and how they affect the BC. We have developed a framework for understanding the BC by looking at the dynamics of coral reef ecosystems. There has been a substantial increase in the reef monitoring efforts globally. We have used the Reef Base datasets to look at the dynamics of the coral reefs. We have used the Reef Base datasets to analyze coral reef dynamics in various ways. We have looked at the dynamics of the coral reef ecosystem in a holistic manner, by looking at the changes in the BC over time

One of the major challenges in natural language processing (NLP) is to perform an interpretive reading of the sentences that allows them to be classified, based on which the sentences can be understood by computers. Some of the popularly used methods in NLP include grammar and semantics, context, and syntactic parsing. Another popular method for NLP is the deep learning technique which is followed in the field of machine learning. This method utilizes the neural network architecture that is inspired by the human brain and is used in both supervised and unsupervised scenarios. This paper discusses the application of deep learning in NLP. In this context, the neural networks and deep learning methods like word embedding, joint embedding, neural language model, and others are discussed. The basic challenges of the NLP are also discussed. Some of the applications of NLP methods are also discussed.
 

In this paper, we present the results of applying a neural network model in the area of natural language processing. We use a long

Coral bleaching is a major phenomenon of global climate change, which causes coral to lose their symbiotic algae. As a result, corals may die. In addition, coral reefs suffer from the loss of coral. Coral loss can be caused by coral diseases such as black-band disease or white plague, or by direct human impacts such as overfishing. To minimize coral loss, we need to know about the coral reproduction process and the mechanisms of coral recovery. Proposed Research: In this project, I will investigate the reproduction process of stony coral and the mechanisms of coral recovery using the healthy coral Favia sp. from Okinawa, Japan. I will use the coral Favia sp. (Fig. 1a) as a model to investigate the reproduction process of the coral and to examine the

I've re-arranged the order of the figure and table, so there is some whitespace in the table.

But it's not surprising that there's some whitespace, because you have a minipage environment around the table, and it's not clear that it's supposed to be positioned absolutely.

The causes of such abrupt changes may not be easily recognized. The existing environmental management policies are not always effective in protecting these fragile ecosystems. Accordingly, a novel integrated modeling approach is proposed to address this issue. This research aims to develop a novel agent-based modeling and simulation approach to address complex environmental problems associated with climate change and natural hazards on coastal wetland ecosystems. This research approach will combine integrated hydrodynamic and water quality models with agent-based modeling (ABM) and simulation that can simulate the complex interactions among social and ecological systems. Specifically, ABM will be applied to simulate the interactions among residents, and between residents and wetlands. The output of the ABM will be used to update the hydrodynamic and water quality models, which will be used for further forecasting. The major tasks of this research are

With climate change already underway and the observed effects of past climate change on the environment, we are rapidly approaching the point where the predictions of climate models will be needed for decision- making. However, the current state of the art in climate predictions is limited because climate models cannot accurately simulate the key processes that govern climate and the response of the climate system to changing forcing factors. One of the most important processes that climate models have difficulty simulating is the land surface- atmosphere interaction. The land surface and atmosphere are closely coupled and changes in the land surface can have a significant impact on the atmosphere and vice versa. Understanding the processes that couple the land surface and atmosphere and the interactions between these processes is necessary to understand and predict future climate

The CZ is the space from the top of the vegetative canopy down to bedrock and lowest extent of freely circulating groundwater.1 The CZ framework provides a holistic approach to develop predictive models that describe processes at the earth’s surface, including the constraints on material export from the continents to fluvial networks.2 Concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships in streams provide an integrated signal of sources and transport processes to examine how solutes and sediment respond to changing patterns of runoff.3 Studies of the CZ are mostly limited to pristine systems; however, C-Q relationships in urban streams may be more complex due to altered hydrology, impaired water quality and heterogenous subcatchments.4 With increasing pressures on urban landscapes

This is an important question because the Río Piedras watershed has undergone significant urban development and its waters are polluted with excessive amounts of nutrients and sediments. These trends are exacerbated by the island’s current financial crisis and the recent hurricanes that have impacted the island. As a result, the Río Piedras watershed has become a case study for understanding the effects of urban development on critical zone structure and function in tropical watersheds. My research would build upon the work of the Luquillo LTER and LCZO networks, who have long-term data sets of hydrological and water quality variables for the Río Piedras watershed; this work would also contribute to efforts of organizations such as the San Juan Bay Estuary Program and the ENLACE project of the Caño Martín Peña that are actively working to restore

APPLICATION OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF AIRCRAFT AND SPACECRAFT
The applications of composite materials in the aerospace industry has increased significantly over the past decade as they provide significant weight savings over other materials, which allows for increased accommodation of payload. There are over 30,000 commercial aircraft using composite materials in their construction. This proposal seeks to solve the problem of GFRP composite aging in aircraft and spacecraft caused by a combination of factors such as moisture and ultraviolet radiation. The proposed solution is to coat the composite materials with a material that will prevent moisture absorption and protect the composite from UV radiation. I will conduct a preliminary study to determine the best coating material for this application, and then use

The expression of the androgen receptor (AR) is elevated in up to 70% of breast cancer patients and is often linked with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. Therefore, the AR and its splice variant (AR-V7) have emerged as attractive therapeutic targets for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. However, the use of antiandrogens such as flutamide or bicalutamide has proven to be ineffective in clinical trials due to the development of resistance resulting from the upregulation of the AR-V7 splice variant. Therefore, the identification of novel AR-V7 inhibitors is essential to overcome resistant disease. We have previously investigated

A majority of these effectors have eukaryotic-like domains such as: F-box, U-box, Sel-1, ankyrin repeats, leucine- rich repeats, and CaaX motifs, which were likely acquired by horizontal gene transfer2. These domains aid in

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mate choice. Sexual selection is a powerful evolutionary force that can lead to the evolution of exaggerated traits10. One of the most studied examples is sexual dimorphism, which is the condition in which males and females of the same species exhibit different phenotypes11.
\item Patterns. There is a possibility that patterns could function as a signal of quality independent of color because some species exhibit dimorphic patterns, which suggests that these may be sexually selected traits2,3. 
\item Zebra finches. Zebra finches are a model for studying mate choice because, in addition to being highly social, their small size and annual breeding cycle make them a tractable system for studying the evolution of ornamentation.
\item Perception. There has been little work done to determine whether female zebra finches are able to perceive variation in dimorphic patterns, and thus, if dimorphic patterns serve

The inputs are election forecasts and the outputs are forecasts of the percentage of votes for each party in the 2019 General Election. 
First, list CLUES (i.e., keywords, phrases, contextual information, semantic relations, semantic meaning, tones, references) for determining the PROPAGATION of FAKE NEWS.
Second, induce a diagnostic REASONING process from CLUES and the input for determining the PROPAGATION of FAKE NEWS.
Third, determine the PROPAGATION of FAKE NEWS as a Fake News or Real News considering CLUES, the REASONING process and the input.

INPUT: Labour. There are many reasons to vote Labour. Here are a few of them: Labour's manifesto is a plan for the many, not the few. It is built on the values of fairness, equality and justice.

ID: 2019_1A_000288 Title: Lesson Study: A Collaborative Approach to the Development of Classroom Assessment Materials Authors: Adam Polhemus, Kristina Scharp, Zhiqin Guo, Rebecca Ullrich Affiliation: University of Oregon Abstract: One way to understand why students do not perform well on assessment items is to understand the nature of the misinterpretations caused by the cognitive demands of the assessment. We present an approach to this problem using lesson study, a collaborative method for the development of classroom assessment materials. The lesson study approach begins with the identification of student misconceptions about a particular topic. The next step involves the development of assessment tasks that can highlight those misconceptions. The third step involves the development of instructional activities to help students overcome the misconceptions. Finally, the activities are piloted in

The epigenome is the heritable changes in gene expression and cellular functions that do not involve changes to the original DNA sequence. Epigenetics studies are essential to understand the resilience of corals and population evolution in a warmer future. As a coral researcher, I want to contribute to the knowledge of coral resilience and susceptibility in an evolutionary and ecologically relevant context. The coral Pocillopora damicornis was chosen for this study, as it is an important reef-building coral in the Indo-Pacific region and is commonly used in laboratory experiments as a model coral.

2024-05-06 13:05:45 - GPT3-Text-Classification : - INFO: returned results - Marine invertebrates such as corals and sea urchins are susceptible to environmental stressors such as ocean warming (OW). In fact, the observed and predicted consequences of OW, including coral bleaching and sea urchin outbreaks, are threatening the stability of coral reef ecosystems.1,2 While the mechanisms of OW-induced mortality are well understood, how corals and urchins will fare under future OW conditions requires further investigation. The study of epigenetics in marine invertebrates is a promising avenue for understanding how resilient these species are to environmental stressors. Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression and cellular functions that do not involve changes to the original DNA sequence.3 Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, are known to play a role in environmental stress responses. For example, elevated seawater temperatures can induce epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, in sea urchin larvae

2024-05-06 13:05:48 - GPT3-Text-Classification : - INFO: returned results - INPUT: I showed that the impact of ocean acidification (OA) on shell dissolution is dependent on the extent of acid-base regulation in the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) forming system. In the context of shell dissolution, the relative importance of OA and pH has been challenging to dissect due to the concomitant changes in other seawater properties, such as carbonate ion concentration (i.e., [CO3(2-)]). I addressed this challenge by investigating the effects of OA and pH on the dissolution of the marine mussel Mytilus trossulus. I showed that OA and pH interact to influence dissolution, with OA having a larger impact at higher pH. This result is consistent with the concept that OA and pH can act independently or synergistically to affect mussel shell dissolution. To better understand this interaction, I investigated the extent of acid-base regulation in M. trossulus and the impacts of OA on acid-base regulation. I found that M. trossulus is capable of

OW has severely diminished coral health through increased disease susceptibility and bleaching.3 To fully understand how corals might fare under future OW conditions, the potential for coral acclimatization over generations and life history stages must be assessed. Previous research on coral acclimatization has focused primarily on intra-generational acclimatization (IGA), which investigates if corals can adjust to new conditions within their lifetime. For example, Brown et al.

INPUT: Correlative imaging techniques have been extensively applied in analyzing the morphology of complex materials and biological specimens. However, these techniques are largely restricted to the imaging of relatively thin samples, because of the limited penetration depth of light. In contrast to conventional imaging modalities, coherent imaging techniques, such as coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy, provide a high penetration depth and ultra-fast imaging speed,

\section{Introduction}
Metabolic networks are biological systems in which many chemical reactions occur in the cells. The human body is an extremely complex network of chemical reactions. Fuel molecules are consumed by cells and released as waste molecules. There are many levels of complexity in the metabolic network. For example, there are many different types of cells in the human body, each with its own metabolic pathways. Many of these pathways are shared among the different types of cells. The most common metabolic pathway is the Krebs cycle, which is found in almost all types of cell. In addition to the Krebs cycle, many other pathways are found in cells as

Ms. Rong Zou, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139
My project is to develop and apply a new graphene-based liquid chromatography method for the determination of small molecule drugs. I will use the graphene-based material as the stationary phase and the supercritical fluid as the mobile phase to separate and quantify the drugs. My project is novel because it utilizes a new material to separate the drugs. The supercritical fluid has also never been used for drug analysis. I will use a supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) method to separate pharmaceutical compounds. In my project, I will use two different types of graphene-based stationary phases coated on the 2.1 mm ID silica capillary column. One is monolayer graphene and the other is few-layer graphene. The supercritical fluid is CO2 or N2O which can be easily obtained in the

INPUT: The role of cognitive inhibition in the development of reading difficulties Keywords: Reading, Cognitive inhibition, Intervention, Brain structure, Individual differences Cognitive inhibition is the ability to control attention and suppress inappropriate responses. It is critical to academic success, and in fact, the later in life it is delayed, the more severe the academic consequences. There is evidence that the delay in cognitive inhibitory control, which occurs during the transition from preschool to elementary school, is a significant risk factor for the development of reading difficulties in the future. There are several theories that suggest the origin of the delay in cognitive inhibitory control. One theory is that the delay in cognitive inhibition is a consequence of the delay in the development of the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for executive functions such as cognitive inhibition. The prefrontal cortex is one of the last regions of the brain to mature. Another theory is that the delay in cognitive inhibition is a consequence of

Episodic memories are characterized by a sense of re-living and visual imagery, and form the basis for developing an autobiographical self. Rubin et al. assessed the qualities of autobiographical memories by measuring variables including degree of reliving, visual and auditory imagery, emotions, setting, and belief1. Recent investigations have begun to probe the shared processes of remembering (“I went to the science museum 2 years ago”) versus imagining (“I imagine myself graduating from college in the future”). Absent from the literature is thorough behavioral data on fictional memories: the memory of an imagined experience without an explicit reference to self, derived from fiction (“I can visualize Atticus Finch standing in a

INPUT: The Mechanism of C-Reactive protein (CRP) in Regulating Host Immune Responses Keywords: CRP, innate immunity, inflammation, adaptive immunity The mechanism by which soluble CRP (sCRP) regulates host immune responses is not understood. sCRP has been widely implicated in promoting the development of adaptive immunity as well as the progression of inflammatory diseases. In early 2008, a team of researchers from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center identified a novel mechanism by which sCRP can regulate adaptive immunity (Chen et al, 2008). They found that sCRP binds to CD14, which is an innate immune receptor on various cell types, and subsequent cell signaling events lead to the production of IL-12 which in turn promotes Th1 cell differentiation.

There is a need for greater understanding of the experiences of individuals with autism (IWA) who also have epilepsy. This study aims to address this need. Epilepsy and autism are two conditions highly associated with each other, with an increased likelihood when epilepsy occurs before the age of three5. There is a lack of research that has focused on the experience of IWA with epilepsy, and one study examined the narratives of IWA with epilepsy and found that IWA experience a high level of stigma, with many perceiving themselves as a burden to others. Other studies have examined the experiences of individuals with epilepsy in general, but none of these studies have focused on IWA. While recent research has aimed to identify the needs of individuals with autism, there is a lack of research that has

As we all know that the Earth is surrounded by a layer of atmosphere and there are some things which are the reason of creation of electromagnetic field. The electromagnetic field is used in our daily life for example in the case of mobile phones, electric motors, and spacecraft. The electromagnetic field can be created by a changing magnetic field or by a changing electric field. The magnetic field is created by the movement of electric charges or by changing electric field. The changing electric field can be produced by high potential. As you know that electricity is produced by the movement of electrons which are negatively charged particles. The electrons move in a wire to produce power. The electrons move from one end of the wire to another, the wire will experience a magnetic field. The electric field is produced by the changing potential difference which is measured in volts. The electric field is produced by

Currently, there are over 70 thousand protein structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), which is the largest database of protein structures. However, the PDB contains only a small fraction of all the possible protein structures, and it is unclear how to use the existing protein structures to predict the structure of the remaining proteins. In addition, the existing methods for predicting protein structure are limited in their predictive ability. There are also gaps in our knowledge of the relationship between protein structure and function. For example, it is not clear how the structure of a protein changes as the protein changes its function. Therefore, it is important to develop new methods to predict protein structure and function.

Introduction:
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known NP-hard problem in computer science, which is to find the shortest path connecting all the nodes in a given graph. It has been studied for over a century, and still remains hard to solve to this day. In the paper “The Cellular Automaton of P. Ackley and G. Hinton and its Application to the Traveling Salesman Problem”, the TSP is modeled by a cellular automaton with a set of rules governing the state of each cell. The cellular automaton is made of a fixed number of cells which can be in one of three states: black, white, and

INPUT: Improving Bounds on the Entropy of Odd Cycle Graphs

Since the first few years of my PhD program, I have been interested in the computer science field. My research in the Computer Science field has been around computational molecular biology and mathematics. I am interested in building a bridge between the two fields. The idea is to use computational methods to solve an experimental question in molecular biology and to use mathematical models to explain the results of computational methods. During my PhD program, I have been developing and refining software for my research. The software is used in the field for various applications. It is a part of a bigger project that tries to explain a link between computational methods and mathematical models. The project is a collaboration between the Department of Biology of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Department of Mathematics of University of Wisconsin-Madison. The project started years ago as a collaboration between two faculty members of the two departments, Dr

I propose to develop an algorithm to determine the relationship between global warming and the increase in the number of suicides in the United States. I will use the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) database of air quality measurements and the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) database of suicide statistics. The EPA data will be used to develop a measure of air quality for each county in the United States. I will then examine the correlation between air quality and the number of suicides in each county.

The EPA measures air quality using different metrics. I will use the Air Quality Index (AQI) because it is the most widely used. The AQI is a single number for each county that combines all the EPA's measurements into one measure. The AQI can be used to determine whether the air quality in a county is good, moderate, or unhealthy. The AQI ranges from 0 to 500. The AQI values are based on the

While we know that the presence of diverse functional traits in an ecosystem is directly linked to the successful provisioning of essential services1, it is often easier to quantify an ecosystem’s genetic diversity than to determine its functional diversity. Unfortunately, we lack a fundamental understanding of the interrelationships between these forms of diversity and whether or not one can be used as a proxy for another. This gap in our knowledge impedes our ability to make management decisions that maximize future ecosystem services.

INPUT: The Ecosystem Services: An Introduction to the Ecosystem Services Framework Key Words: Ecosystem Services, Ecosystem-based Management, Valuation, Natural Capital, Natural Capital Accounting Introduction: Ecosystem services were first defined by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) as the benefits that people receive from ecosystems. They include regulating services (benefits that nature provides to regulate environmental processes), provisioning services (benefits that nature provides in the form of products or services), cultural services (benefits that people receive from nature through recreation, spiritual fulfillment, education, etc.), and supporting services (ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling and primary production that underpin the other ecosystem services). The MA defines ecosystem services

Rationale: Disturbance is a factor that triggers an ecosystem response. The ecosystem response after disturbance is determined by the level of disturbance and the characteristics of the ecosystem (e.g., natural disturbance regime, species diversity, etc.). Disturbance effects are the ecosystem's response after disturbance. Disturbance effects are also called ecosystem responses.

2024-05-06 13:09:49 - GPT3-Text-Classification : - INFO: returned results - INPUT: Introduction: Arctic ozone depletion events (ODEs) are a growing concern – they are a key component of the Arctic climate system and affect the global climate. ODEs are caused by the release of reactive halogen species (RHXs), such as bromine (Br), chlorine (Cl), and iodine (I), into the Arctic atmosphere. As the RHXs increase, they deplete ozone (O3) from the atmosphere, creating an ozone hole. This research focuses on the role of I in ODEs. I is present in the atmosphere as iodide (I-) and as molecular iodine (I2). When the RHXs from the winter snowpack are exposed to ozone in the spring, I2 is produced. I2 is then oxidized to produce more ozone. The ozone produced is then removed by the RHXs and a second ozone depletion event occurs. The process repeats for several years. However, as the RHXs increase,

CLUES:
I. Introduction: To better understand the impact of global climate change and the effects of increased biogenic and anthropogenic emissions, more research is needed into the unique photochemical processes that take place in the Arctic atmosphere. Although geographically remote, the Arctic has a significant impact on globally important feedbacks to climate change.
II. Problem Statement: To date, few successful in-situ measurements of iodine compounds have been achieved in the Arctic due to the lack of analytical methods. As a result, iodine chemistry is often omitted from current climate models that simulate Arctic ODEs, which may significantly underestimate the rate of ozone depletion. Research Objectives: This study proposes the exploration of new technologies and methods for the selective, quantitative chemical detection of iodine compounds that may play an important role in Arctic ODEs. In this study, I propose to investigate new analytical procedures and instrumentation to observe and quantify I and IO

2024-05-06 13:10:06 - GPT3-Text-Classification : - INFO: returned results - INPUT: Conclusion: The Arctic has unique chemical processes and feedbacks to climate change. The primary oxidant in the troposphere is the ozone. The bromine is the primary driver of ozone destruction. The bromine has a stable and high abundance in the Arctic in the springtime. The bromine is the precursor for most of the oxidizing, or self-cleaning, capacity in the 3 troposphere. The iodine chemistry is the major process of ozone destruction in the springtime. The iodine chemistry is a critical process that is omitted in the current climate models. This study proposes the exploration of new technologies and methods for the selective, quantitative chemical detection of iodine compounds that may play an important role in Arctic ODEs. In this study, I propose to investigate new analytical procedures and instrumentation to observe and quantify I and IO 2 during springtime Arctic ODEs. This work will then allow iodine chemistry to be incorporated with reduced uncertainty into kinetic analyses and computer model simulations

Research Statement:
1. Ozone is the precursor for most of the self-cleaning capacity in the troposphere. 2. During springtime episodic depletions of tropospheric ozone, and the characteristic photochemistry involved, are current areas of considerable research. 3. Since ozone (O) is the precursor for most of the self-cleaning capacity in the troposphere, it generally controls the oxidation potential of the atmosphere.
4. Similar to the discovery of stratospheric ozone depletion, observations of ozone depletion events (ODEs) in the polar boundary layer (BL) were surprising. 5. Ozone depletion events were associated with elevated concentrations of halogenated radicals. 6. The conversion of inert halide salt ions into reactive halogenated species has been shown to deplete ozone following the onset of Polar Sunrise. 7.

Although geographically remote, the Arctic has a significant impact on globally important feedbacks to climate change. Since ozone (O) is the precursor for most of the oxidizing, or self-cleaning, capacity in the 3 troposphere, it generally controls the oxidation potential of the atmosphere. Similar to the discovery of stratospheric ozone depletion, observations of ozone depletion events (ODEs) in the polar boundary layer (BL) were surprising. Springtime episodic depletions of tropospheric O, and the characteristic photochemistry 3 involved, are current areas of considerable research. These sudden and recurrent ODEs during late winter and spring are associated with elevated concentrations of halogenated radicals. The conversion of inert halide salt ions into reactive halogenated species has

2024-05-06 13:10:35 - GPT3-Text-Classification : - INFO: returned results - REASONING (CLUES): GLOBAL CLIMATE change, increased EMISSIONS, research is needed into the unique PHOTOCHEMICAL processes that take place in the Arctic atmosphere, while geographically remote, the Arctic has a significant impact on globally important feedbacks to climate change. Although it is widely accepted that bromine is the primary driver of ODEs via photochemical reactions, the role of iodine chemistry in ozone destruction and oxidizing strength of the atmosphere is not well understood. These models have also shown that interactions with iodine may double the efficiency of bromine in ozone depletion. The proposed research will investigate new analytical procedures and instrumentation to observe and quantify I and IO 2 during springtime Arctic ODEs. This work will then allow iodine chemistry to be incorporated with reduced uncertainty into kinetic analyses and computer model simulations. To date, few successful in-situ measurements of iodine compounds have been achieved in the Arctic due to the lack of analytical methods. This study proposes the exploration

\section{Summary of the main ideas of this paper}

In this paper, we have proposed an approach for determining whether the given INPUT (i.e., the research proposals submitted to NSF GRF) is a Winner or Honorable Mention considering the CLUES (i.e., keywords, phrases, contextual information, semantic relations, semantic meaning, tones, references) and the REASONING process. The CLUES are generally the keywords, phrases, contextual information, semantic relations and semantic meaning which can be easily extracted from the INPUT. The REASONING process is determined from the CLUES and the INPUT. The REASONING process is based on the diagnostic reasoning process which is usually used in the decision support systems. The diagnostic reasoning process is the process to find the solutions to the problems by finding the reasons of how the given INPUT (problem) is caused by the CLUES (solution). The diagnostic reasoning process indicates the overall SUCCESS of INPUT by determining whether the INPUT

Hi @mohannad, and welcome to the forum. You are right that this is a very challenging task. I am not sure how far you should try to go with this, but if you do complete it, please do let us know. We encourage anyone who submits a solution to include some notes on how they went about approaching the problem: what software/tools they used, what language(s), data sources, pre-processing, etc. And, of course, a link to your code.

I notice that you are using LaTeX; is that because you are a LaTeX expert, or because you don’t know how to use some other text editor for writing code? Because if it’s the former, then you might want to post a copy of your code in the GitHub code editor, which will be familiar to many of the users

\section{Problem Formulation}
\label{sec:problem}

\par\noindent In this study, we attempt to tackle a two-dimensional problem (i.e., text classification problem) by focusing on the two dimensions. Our input (i.e., research proposal applications) and output (i.e., the Winner or Honorable Mention) are represented by two-dimensional data (i.e., text). In addition, we consider the input research proposal applications as input vector that is a complex structure. The input vector contains keywords, phrases, references, and all other contextual information related to the application. In the same way, the output is also represented by two-dimensional data. The output is a Winner or Honorable Mention.

INPUT: Our team has been able to successfully complete the automated detection of a number of high priority events that fall within the standard data stream. These events are ones that are "expected" to occur in a leptonic decay of a tau, and are therefore of great interest. We have already conducted a search for a tau neutrino, which did not result in a discovery. We are now searching for a tau antineutrino. Our algorithm has been successful in detecting the tau neutrino signals as they occur in the data stream, but the tau antineutrino signals are much more difficult, as they are harder to distinguish from the background. The algorithm

Development of a fully-automated, low-cost, near-infrared spectrometry-based device for sepsis detection and management
By: 
The global burden of sepsis is high, resulting in 1.5-5 million deaths per year. Sepsis is characterized by systemic inflammation and is linked to increased mortality, and is the most common cause of death in intensive care units (ICUs). Current sepsis management involves repeated blood draws to detect the presence of sepsis, which leads to unnecessary blood loss and hemolysis of red blood cells. Early detection of sepsis is critical for improved patient outcomes and reduced mortality; however, early detection is challenging due to the lack of a noninvasive, rapid, and inexpensive method. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, which measures the interaction between light and matter, has the potential to screen for sepsis and provide continuous monitoring of inflammatory cytokines.

Research Topic: Breast cancer, Metabolomics, Machine Learning
Title: Machine Learning for Breast Cancer Prediction using Breast Tissue Metabolomics
Abstract: Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of death among women. It is estimated that 1 in 8 women will develop invasive breast cancer in her lifetime. Early detection of breast cancer is essential for optimal treatment and better prognosis. In this work, we propose to use machine learning to predict breast cancer from breast tissue metabolomics. Breast cancer tissue metabolomics is a relatively new field that studies the metabolites in breast cancer and normal tissue. The metabolites in breast are influenced by many factors including physiological, nutritional, and

In the gut, bacteria break down polysaccharides into health-beneficial end products of metabolism called short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that are taken up and used for energy by host intestinal cells. The gut microbiome is an ideal model to study this type of ecosystem, as we know what nutrients these bacteria are exposed to and have access to powerful tools to study taxonomy and metabolism. Gut bacteria have been shown to break down polysaccharides in waves, with primary degrader species upregulating genes of interest at early time points, followed by secondary degraders. However, these studies focused on a single species, and it is unknown if these same patterns occur with all species involved in polysaccharide degradation. The goal of this project is to determine if the gut microbiome’s ability to breakdown polysaccharides is dependent on a community of species

Research Description

Unraveling the process of polysaccharide utilization in complex bacterial ecosystems
Abstract: Bacteria do not exist in isolation in nature; they form complex communities in which they must recognize, compete over, and, share nutrient resources. The gut microbiome is an ideal model to study this type of ecosystem, as we know what nutrients these bacteria are exposed to and have access to powerful tools to study taxonomy and metabolism. Gut bacteria break down polysaccharide nutrients and convert them to health-beneficial end products of metabolism called short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that are taken up and used for energy by host intestinal cells. However, there is a gap in our understanding of what factors give rise to the emergent phenomenon of SCFA production. The leading hypothesis in the field is that communities that fail to respond to a given polysac

Author: Sejin Shin
Abstract: Many companies are using a personality test (e.g., DISC) to predict how a candidate will fit into a particular position. However, a personality test is not perfect because it is based on a subjective judgement. In this study, we trained a classifier using natural language processing (NLP) to predict a personality trait from a text. The result shows that our model can predict a personality trait with an accuracy of 80.1%.

Background
Fuel Cell provides a clean and efficient energy source for electric cars. But the commercialization of fuel cell has been hindered due to the high cost of hydrogen production. The most common way of producing hydrogen is through steam reforming of natural gas, which needs high temperature (over 700℃) and pressure (over 20MPa) to produce hydrogen. The high temperature is costly for the production of steam and hydrogen. The high pressure is required to decompose the methane into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a more efficient and economical way to produce hydrogen. In this project, we aim to develop a new type of fuel cell which can generate hydrogen at room temperature.

It is important to determine the effectiveness and durability of these products with respect to virus transmission. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been shown to survive on surfaces for hours to days, and can be transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces. Despite the current need for PPE (e.g., N95 masks), there is a lack of standardization for the testing of these products. The CDC has issued guidelines for the testing of PPE for viruses, but these guidelines are not standard across the industry. A standardized testing method would allow for a comparison between different PPE products, and would allow for the emergence of best practices for the testing of PPE. Hypothesis: The SARS-CoV-2 virus can be detected using a lateral flow strip and a portable smartphone. Experimental Plan: The current methods for detecting

Today, vaccines exist for 26 viral diseases1, but low yields and high costs of production prevent access to many vaccines. Similarly, production limitations will reduce access to viral gene therapy, which may provide cures to single-mutation genetic diseases. Although many technologies exist for virus particle purification, they each face unique roadblocks to developing rapid, high-yielding, and ultimately continuous processes.

My question is how to make the pdf file includes the text of the proposal in the same page? That is, I want the proposal in pdf to be edited with the following format:

I tried to use package `memoir` and `multicol` but they do not work. It seems they are not suitable for this purpose. Thank you so much for your help.

UPDATE: I used a comment by @cfr, I got the following:

And I have to use \begin{multicols}{2} to separate the text. I want the text to be on a page not in a column. How can I do this? Thank you.

The cost of sequencing has dropped dramatically over the past decade with the number of sequencing centers increasing world-wide. This increase in sequencing capacity has enabled large scale studies in both humans and model organisms, and increased the applicability of sequencing as a tool in many research labs. However, the sequencing paradigm that has been used in the past for high throughput sequencing is not well suited to the analysis of rare variants. The current paradigm for next generation sequencing is to either sequence the whole genome, whole exome or some subset of a genome. However, this approach is not readily scalable to large numbers of samples or to the analysis of rare variants. In addition, the current sequencing paradigm for analyzing rare variants is not well suited to analysis of single cells. The current paradigm for single cell analysis is to isolate the cell and extract the genomic DNA, amplify the regions of interest (exons)

We tried to build a classifier based on a sequential decision-making process that consists of three steps. The first step is to identify CLUES (i.e., keywords, phrases, contextual information, semantic relations, semantic meaning, tones, references) for determining the overall SUCCESS of INPUT. For example, the CLUES can be the keywords and phrases such as "IGM", "EoR", "Lyα" and so on. The second step is to induce a diagnostic REASONING process from CLUES and the INPUT for determining the overall SUCCESS. For example, the REASONING process can be a logical or mathematical process that consists of the organization of the CLUES and the INPUT. The third step is to determine the overall SUCCESS of INPUT as Winner or Honorable Mention considering CLUES, the REASONING process and the INPUT. For example, the overall SUCCESS can be the Winner or Honorable Mention considering CLUES, the REASONING process and the

The IGM is the matter that existed between galaxies during the early stages of the Universe. During the EoR, the Universe was dominated by neutral hydrogen (HI) that was not ionized until the first galaxies formed. My main research goal is to understand how and when the IGM became fully ionized. We can study the EoR by observing the emission from the youngest galaxies, which are fainter and were further away than we can observe today. However, the ionizing radiation from these galaxies is attenuated by the neutral hydrogen in the IGM, making it difficult to observe. I am interested in how the IGM changes during the EoR. I will use observations of galaxies detected in the ultraviolet (UV) and in the near-infrared

\section*{1. Introduction}
The problem is to identify whether an applicant is the Winner or Honorable Mention. We use machine learning algorithms (i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier) to identify the Winner or Honorable Mention, based on the research proposals submitted to NSF GRF applications. The inputs are research proposals submitted to NSF GRF applications and this is a overall success classifier to identify whether the applicants will be the Winner or Honorable Mention.

\section*{2. Methods}
First, list CLUES (i.e., keywords, phrases, contextual information, semantic relations, semantic meaning, tones, references) for determining the overall SUCCESS of INPUT.
Second, induce a diagnostic REASONING process from CLUES and the INPUT for determining the overall SUCCESS (Limit the number of words to 130).
Third, determine the overall SUCCESS of INPUT as Winner or Honorable Mention considering CLUES, the REASONING process and the INPUT.

Various studies, including those by Lee et al. (2017) have shown that CO(1–0) emission can arise from a number of different mechanisms. These include the rotation of the galaxy, the presence of outflows which transport gas to the galaxy outskirts, and the presence of shock fronts. However, the majority of these studies have been carried out on nearby galaxies and do not address the gas dynamics of high-z galaxies. 0 With the discovery of a population of galaxies with CO(1–0) emission from deep ALMA observations, the number of high-z galaxies with CO(1–0) emission is slowly growing

INPUT: High-energy neutrinos are of great interest for their cosmological implications, but their detection is hindered by their low detection efficiency in current neutrino telescopes, their high background, and their short mean free path. One way to overcome these issues is to exploit the fact that neutrinos are charged particles by searching for secondary particles, produced by cosmic rays interacting in the Earth’s atmosphere. This can be accomplished in a relatively large detector with a high duty cycle, as the Earth’s atmosphere is transparent to charged particles. In particular, the area of interest for these searches is around the highest-energy cosmic rays, with energies of 10^19-10^20 eV. The Pierre Auger Observatory

I propose to design an experiment to investigate the influence of vibrations on the human body. The experiment will consist of two parts: one in which the participants perform a task while subjected to vibrations and the other in which they perform the same task without vibrations. I will record the results of both experiments in order to analyze the effects of vibrations on the human body. The results will be compared to the vibrations that astronauts are exposed to when working on the ISS. The results from the proposed experiment will provide support for studies on the effects of vibrations on human performance.
The two proposed experiments are designed to test the effects of vibrations on the human body. There are three sets of input research questions. First, we need to know the effects of vibrations on the human body. Second, we need to know how the human body responds to vibrations. Third, we need to know whether vibrations affect humans in the

2024-05-06 13:15:42 - GPT3-Text-Classification : - INFO: returned results - CLUES: One of the most important unknowns in high-z extragalactic astronomy is how reionization occurred; during the epoch of reionization (z≈10–6; EoR), neutral hydrogen (HI) dominates the intergalactic medium (IGM). HI attenuates radiation from early stellar populations, masking galaxies from detection. Understanding how and when reionization occurs can reveal whether or not these young galaxies provided the necessary ionizing radiation to completely reionize the IGM by z(cid:39)6, one billion years after the Big Bang. However, due to the high redshift-space this implies, spectroscopic observations are limited as these galaxies are very faint, with their UV spectral features pushed out to near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. My background in NIR spectroscopy and observational astronomy has prepared me to assist in addressing this question. I propose using Lyα and CIII] to investigate the properties and ionization state of young galaxies using ground

RESULT: WINNER
Diemer & Kravtsov (2014) [3] demonstrated that the splashback radius is the radius where the outermost particles of the halo turn around from their first pericentric passage, also known as the caustic radius. This is the radius outside of which the total mass within the dark matter halo is approximately constant. Aun et al. (2021) [8] also predicted that the inner edge of the splashback profile is the radius where the kinematical signature of the halo turns around from its first pericentric passage. This is the radius where the internal energy of the halo first becomes negligible. The splashback radius is also the radius where the speed of the halo particles within the halo becomes negligible. The splashback radius is also the radius where the internal pressure of the halo becomes negligible. The splashback radius is also the radius where the internal pressure of the halo becomes negligible. The splashback radius

There are a few things that can be done to improve your code. First, you can use \begin{document} and \end{document} to surround your entire document. Second, the list of CLUES should be a paragraph and not a series of lines. Third, you can use \begin{display} and \end{display} to surround your code blocks. Finally, I would recommend using a table environment to display your input as it is a table and not a paragraph. – Andrew Jun 26 at 14:42

\section{The CLUES-ENRICHED Knowledge Base}
\label{sec:clues-enriched}

We have extracted and organized the CLUES from each example into a knowledge base. Each CLUES is represented as a triplet $\langle word, relation, value\rangle$. For example, the CLUES for the first example is $\langle motivation, belongs to, functional magnetic resonance imaging\rangle$. Now, we can  use these CLUES to enrich the knowledge base. For example, the CLUES for the second example is $\langle input, belongs to, research proposal submitted to NSF GRF\rangle$, $\langle input, belongs to, research proposals submitted to NSF GRF\rangle$, and $\langle input, belongs to, overall success classifier\rangle$.

\section{The Diagnostic Reasoning Process}

Aim 3: I will predict the rate constants for these PCET reactions using a vibronically nonadiabatic PCET theory and will probe the electronic effects as the substituent on the Y or W is changed. The information calculated from the previous aims will be used as input to the analytical rate constant expression for vibronically nonadiabatic PCET. The underlying PCET theory is related to Marcus theory for electron transfer reactions,4 but the transferring proton is also treated quantum mechanically to include hydrogen tunneling.3 In the past, this theory has been applied to enzymes such as soybean lipoxygenase,5 illuminating the role of protein motions on the large kinetic isotope effect observed experimentally.

The partial charges representing the protein environment will be obtained from the MD simulations in Aim 2. The experimentally measured relative redox potentials from our collaborators on tyrosine and its derivatives will be used to benchmark our methods. The influence of the protein has been viewed as a constant shift compared to aqueous values, and finding theoretical evidence to support or disprove this assumption, as well as an explanation, would be valuable. Preliminary data (Table 1) for implicit solvation studies reproduces the ordering and magnitude of the experimental redox potentials in the protein very well, suggesting that the protein is uniformly affecting each chemical species and cancels out when computing relative redox potentials.

2024-05-06 13:17:43 - GPT3-Text-Classification : - INFO: returned results - Background: Protein purification is required for protein structural determination, functional studies, and biotechnology applications. The state-of-the-art approach for protein purification is by using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). SEC is often used as a final step before crystallization to remove aggregates. Although it is a common and widely-used technique, it is not well understood at the molecular level. Recent studies indicated that the size-exclusion mechanism is dominated by the hydrophobic effect; however, to date, there are no detailed and quantitative studies on the role of hydrophobic interactions in the size-exclusion mechanism. The main objective of this work is to develop a theoretical and computational framework to understand the size-exclusion mechanism in SEC. This work is significant because it provides a fundamental understanding of the size-exclusion mechanism that can be used to design new SEC systems and improve the efficiency of protein purification. This work is also important because it provides a theoretical framework to explain recent experimental results on the size-exclusion mechanism that were

I'm looking for stories along the lines of Master of the Universe, Hybrid Theory, and The Devil's In The Details.
A few things I'm looking for include unique settings (such as fantasy worlds, but also alternate history worlds), interesting powers (such as superpowers, but also technology and magic), and a focus on worldbuilding and naturalistic characters.
I'm not looking for stories that are just for smut with decent worldbuilding, nor am I looking for stories that have a lot of smut with a little bit of world building.

Introduction: Theelectronicstructureofmaterialsisarequiredinputinmanytheoreticalandexperimental studies. In order to learn how the electronic structure of a material depends on its atomic structure, it is necessary to perform ab-initio electronic structure calculations. The main idea is to perform as many calculations as possible to get a full description of the properties of a material. The most common approach is to perform ab-initio electronic structure calculations to get the optimized geometry and the electronic structure of the material. The electronic structure is then used to determine the properties of the material. The procedure is then repeated with a larger number of calculations. There are many studies of the electronic

An Agent-based Context-aware Recommendation System for Recommender Systems: A Case Study of GRFP Award
Abstract
Recommender systems (RS) have been widely used in many applications, such as news and movies recommendations. However, the recommendations are usually based on either a single context (e.g., users' recent behavior), or a combination of multiple contexts (e.g., users' historical information), with little consideration of the contexts in different granularities. In this paper, we propose a novel agent-based

This example shows how to use the commands \renewcommand and \newcommand to change a LaTeX command. Note that the new command is named \mysymbol and the old command is named \myoldcommand.

In this example, we use the command \renewcommand to change the meaning of the LaTeX command \chapter to add a new parameter. The new command is named \mychapter and the old command is named \chapter.

The following example shows how to use the command \renewcommand to change the meaning of the LaTeX command \chapter to make its first parameter an optional parameter. The new command is named \mychapter and the old command is named \chapter.

Note that the new command \mychapter takes an optional parameter. The optional parameter is followed by a square bracket. When the optional parameter is not used the square bracket must still be included.

We consider the sentence encoder as a special case of a task-agnostic neural model with the objective to extract word embeddings and word-pair embeddings. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the baseline.

Research Description I will be conducting research in the field of Lie Theory, under the direction of Rob Rimanyi. A Lie algebra is a nonlinear vector space equipped with an anticommutative operation α (cid:54)= −α and a bilinear operation, [x,y] = xy − yx, called a Lie bracket. The Lie algebra is said to be semisimple if the Lie bracket is antisymmetric. If all elements of the Lie algebra are simultaneously diagonalizable, then the Lie algebra is said to be semisimple. An abelian Lie algebra is called a toral subalgebra. A subset of the Lie algebra is said to be a Cartan subalgebra if it is a maximal toral subalgebra. In particular, the Cartan subalgebra is abelian, and thus each element of the Cartan subalgebra is simultaneously ad

I think that the easiest thing to do is to force the text to break where is required, and then to use a package such as the multicol package for the main text. The multicol package allows you to have up to 9 columns. I have used 9 columns here to make the code easier to read. I have also added a footer. It is also possible to have a header.

To use the multicol package, you need to add the following commands around the text to be put into the multicol environment.

\usepackage{multicol}
\begin{multicols}{9}
\begin{verbatim}

\end{multicols}

HI attenuates radiation from early stellar populations, masking galaxies from detection. Understanding how and when reionization occurs can reveal whether or not these young galaxies provided the necessary ionizing radiation to completely reionize the IGM by z(cid:39)6, one billion years after the Big Bang. However, due to the high redshift-space this implies, spectroscopic observations are limited as these galaxies are very faint, with their UV spectral features pushed out to near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. My background in NIR spectroscopy and observational astronomy has prepared me to assist in addressing this question. I propose using Lyα and CIII] to investigate the properties and ionization state of young galaxies using ground

3.3 A Case Study of the CLUES Framework

To evaluate the performance of the CLUES framework, we use the research proposals submitted to NSF GRF applications in four years. The prediction results, including the overall success classifier and the input examples, are shown in Table 1. The last column shows the proposed framework can predict the overall success of those applications as Winner or Honorable Mention with an accuracy of 93.75%. Most of the reasonable inputs and the related reasoning processes are shown in Table 2. We can see that the framework can identify the correct reasoning process, including the major topics, the details of the research proposals and the additional supporting information.

I worked with a specific galaxy, A2744_YD4 (z=10.3), where I took spectra of the galaxy over a period of time in order to measure the variability of the galaxy’s emission lines, in particular OI (λ=1302˚A).

The existence of DM was proposed in the 1930s to explain the rotation curves of galaxies, and a particle theory of DM was put forth in the 1970s. The evidence for DM is incontrovertible, yet no particle has been identified. Numerous experiments are currently being conducted to look for DM particles, like the Large Hadron Collider, and the Large Underground Xenon experiment. I have conducted research in the area of DM for nearly two years, and I have assisted in designing a new experiment at the University of Chicago, the Mu2e experiment, which is searching for DM using the muon. Muons are elementary particles with a mass of 206 times the mass of an electron. The muon is unique from other types of particles – it is an elementary particle, so it cannot decay or break into other particles.

Despite a growing body of research on this topic, the underlying reasons for these differences are still not completely understood, and this topic is far from being fully understood. The first aim of this project is to determine whether pronoun use is related to gender and social relationships. Based on the evidence that children’s use of pronouns is related to social cognition, it may be that pronoun use increases with more well-defined social relationships. Second, this project will establish a connection between pronoun use and children’s emotional development. Using both observational and experimental measures, I will examine whether children’s pronoun use is related to their ability to take others’ perspectives and to their emotional development. The third aim of this project will establish the role of individual differences in a child’s cognitive and socio-emotional development in

INTRODUCTION

The dynamics of the cytoplasm, which includes the cell chromosome and other intracellular particles is relevant to many biological processes, including cell replication and genomic control. However, these systems exist out of equilibrium and show complex dynamic behavior, not easily explained by classic dynamic theory. Recently, new fluorescent labeling techniques have allowed intracellular particles to be tracked as they move though the cell1,2. These experiments, done on E. coli, have shown that that these particles show sub-diffusive behavior. It seems that the cell environment confines the movement of these particles, and blocks them from fully exploring their surroundings. Various theories have been proposed to explain this behavior.3,4.

Training.
A total of 205 research proposals were collected from the NSF GRF program, and preliminary results were obtained as shown in Fig. 1. The data were collected from 2012 to 2019, and the number of articles was approximately 36 per year. This research analyzed the articles based on the contents, and the number of articles was 46, 53, 43, 51, and 52 in 2012-2016, respectively. The number of articles was 46 in 2016, and the number of articles was 47 in 2017 and 2018, and 51 in 2019.
It was confirmed that it was difficult to train a machine learning model when the number of articles was small because the articles were insufficient. Therefore, a total of 205 articles were collected from 2012 to 2019, and the titles of the articles were collected.
In addition, the articles were

The National Science Foundation  (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) supports outstanding graduate students in NSF-supported STEM disciplines who are pursuing research-based master's and doctoral degrees at accredited United States institutions. The program recognizes and supports individuals who have demonstrated their potential for significant achievements in science and engineering research. 
It is important to evaluate the quality of the research proposal (INPUT) before the awarding the GRFP. The INPUT includes the abstracts, research statements, and the CVs of the applicants for the GRFP. 
The outputs of the RPE are the quality of the INPUT and the definition of the quality of the INPUT. 
First, we list the CLUES for determining the quality of the INPUT. 
Second, we induce a diagnostic REASONING process from the CLUES and the INPUT for determining the quality of the INPUT.

This model will allow for the isolation of the core mechanisms that underlie substance abuse, which may depend on VTA-HPC interactions. The proposed research will dissect how VTA-HPC interactions contribute to the complexity of behaviors associated with substance abuse by elucidating how both state-dependent and event-evoked interactions drive memory encoding. Even in my anecdotal experience employing active teaching techniques to engagement ees, I have found that giving individuals’ agency over minor choices, such as choosing what topic to read and discuss, and more substantial choices, such as choosing a research topic, leads to significantly more engagement and long-term retention. The proposed research will directly test how agency can affect motivation and learning at various timescales, which will contribute both to our understanding of how it can support learning and how we may utilize it to broadly enhance teaching methods.

Machine Learning for Catalytic Synthesis of NOx-Reducing Catalysts
Funding Agency: National Science Foundation
Role: Principal Investigator
Project Summary: Catalytic NOx-Reduction with Hydrocarbons (CNH) is an important technology for the removal of harmful nitrogen oxides (NOx) from combustion exhaust gas. CNH occurs in a wide range of industrial and automotive applications, but the development of new catalysts has been hampered by the lack of effective computational approaches to predict the active sites for CNH, which is necessary for rational catalyst design. The proposed research will use machine learning (ML) methods to explore the relationship between catalyst structure and activity for CNH, with the goal of discovering new catalysts with improved activity. The research will be carried out in collaboration with Prof. John Vajo (Virginia Tech), an expert in the

There are 3 main components of input:

1. CLUES: free, first-principles theoretical treatment of core-to-core x-ray emission spectroscopy (ctc-XES). Success in this research program will have wide impact for refining analytical and fundamental study of the element- specific electronic structure in highly correlated materials, an extremely broad class with significant industrial, technical, and environmental relevance. Furthermore, by having fully addressed the forward problem, i.e., prediction with no adjustable parameters of ctc-XES spectra from local structure, we will be able to use unsupervised and supervised machine learning (ML) methods to understand the information content in core-to-core XES across systems already widely studied (e.g., 3d transition metals) and also systems that have seem comparatively little XES (e.g., materials with heavy d- and f-electron elements). This will likely lead to prediction of new diagnostic spectral signatures of magnetism in f-electron systems.

\subsection*{Environment description:}
This is the NSF GRFP research proposal submitted to NSF GRFP by Karthik Krishnaswamy in 2021. The inputs are research proposals submitted to NSF GRF applications and this is a overall success classifier to identify whether the applicants will be the Winner or Honorable Mention. 
First, list CLUES (i.e., keywords, phrases, contextual information, semantic relations, semantic meaning, tones, references) for determining the overall SUCCESS of INPUT.
Second, induce a diagnostic REASONING process from CLUES and the INPUT for determining the overall SUCCESS (Limit the number of words to 130).
Third, determine the overall SUCCESS of INPUT as Winner or Honorable Mention considering CLUES, the REASONING process and the INPUT.

INPUT: 2019 and 2020. In 2019, I was accepted into the Materials Science and Engineering Translational Research Program (MSERT) at the University of Washington

(c) Simulation using costs from (a) and (b). The winning proposal will be the one that better explains the data. The proposal has the potential to explain how vocal development happens in marmoset monkeys and likely other species, including humans and other vocal learners. It incorporates different factors important for vocal development into one framework, highlighting the importance of the body and the environment into behavior. The stepwise model is also generalizable to other behavioral systems (e.g., locomotion), and thus potentially useful to describe the transitions we see when categorizing any behavior into different stages.

2024-05-06 13:23:04 - GPT3-Text-Classification : - INFO: returned results - INPUT: Title: The effect of the type of learning environment on the development of human cognitive functions Background: The brain development is affected by the external environment. It has been shown that people who grow up in a more stimulating environment, such as children who grow up in inner cities in the US, are better at learning and have a higher IQ. This is due to a phenomenon caled plasticity, which is the ability of the brain to adapt to the environment during early childhood. The effect of the type of learning environment on the development of human cognitive functions has not been studied. I propose to investigate how the learning environment affects cognitive functions using a large data set of twins. Hypothesis: The study of twins will help to isolate the effect of the learning environment from the genetic component. I hypothesize that the children with skilled parents, who have more education, will grow up in a more stimulating environment, and thus will be better at learning. Aim 1: Investigate the effect of the

Abstract
Introduction: Pneumonia is the leading cause of death in adults and children worldwide. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading pathogen associated with pneumonia. Pneumococcal pneumonia is characterized by a robust influx of immune cells into the lung, including neutrophils. Despite the importance of neutrophils in pneumococcal pneumonia, the molecular mechanisms underlying neutrophil recruitment and function are poorly understood. Methods: We performed transcriptome and translational profiling of neutrophils isolated from the broncho

The evaluation of the reason for success of a research proposal is a complex problem that involves many factors. As we have seen in the past, the complexity of the factors involved in a research proposal and the significant amount of computational resources required for such an analysis make it difficult to find a solution to this problem. Therefore, it is important that the research community produce more studies that can be used to validate the effectiveness of research proposal evaluation methods. In addition, it is important to create a system that can be used to provide a more objective evaluation of the research proposal without relying on the experience of a single person. In this study, we propose a system that can evaluate a research proposal through text mining, reasoning, and machine learning. The evaluation of the overall success of a research proposal is a complex problem. A research proposal is successful if it is approved by the grant agency. Therefore, research proposals have to meet specific conditions when applying to grant agencies. The evaluation of the overall success is a complex

It is an interesting idea and I think it is possible to implement in the context of dialog modeling. However, I think the current paper is not ready for submission to CLIPS. This is because there are too many assumptions and the paper is not well written. I will point out some things that I personally felt were problematic.

- I think the first sentence of the motivation section should be edited. Right now you are saying you are modeling the input as a sequence. In the next paragraph your model is a sequence to sequence model. I don't think it really makes sense to do both.
- I don't think you need this many references in the introduction. I would remove all of the references except the final one. If you cite the final one in the introduction, there is no need to reference it again later in the paper.
- I think the motivation should be placed before the introduction.
- This sentence should be edited: "In [12], the authors proposed a

\item \textbf{CLUES} We identify CLUES to be keywords, phrases, contextual information, semantic relations, semantic meaning, tones, references. The CLUES are extracted from the foreword, motivation, and limitation of the submitted input.
\item \textbf{REASONING PROCESS} The REASONING PROCESS is the overall SUCCESS classifier. It consists of four inputs: (1) CLUES, (2) INPUT, (3) SETTING, and (4) LIMITATIONS. The CLUES are the same as the INPUT CLUES. The INPUT is the research proposal submitted to the NSF GRF application. The SETTING is the proposed research environment, for example, the combination of the biological systems and the microfluidics devices. The LIMITATIONS are the problems

The core idea of DIAGNOSIS-GRF is to determine the overall SUCCESS of INPUT using CLUES, the REASONING process and the INPUT.
Therefore, we induce the REASONING process for INPUT using CLUES.
First, we determine the CLUES of INPUT using the keywords, phrases, contextual information, semantic relations, semantic meaning, and tones.
Second, we determine the CLUES of INPUT using the references.
Third, we determine the CLUES of INPUT using the semantic relations.
Fourth, we induce the REASONING process for INPUT using the CLUES.
Fifth, we determine the overall SUCCESS of INPUT considering CLUES, the REASONING process and the INPUT.

INPUT: The indicators for social mobility, such as education opportunities and labor market opportunities, are very closely associated with the income level of the family. Families with higher incomes have more opportunities for their children to receive education and get employed, which causes a higher level of achievement in these families. Therefore, it is important to investigate the relationship between the income level and the social mobility. With this research, I want to investigate the relationship between the income level and the social mobility in terms of the educational attainment and the labor market attainment. I am interested in this topic because this research would not only improve the understanding of the income level and

INPUT: Community Recovery Following Post-Industrial Land-Use Change Introduction: Largely dominated by spruce-fir forests, the White Mountains of New Hampshire have been altered by logging and mining activities in the 19th and early 20th century. Successional changes in these forests following industrial land-use change are thought to be a significant source of uncertainty in climate change predictions. In particular, many models predict that the structure and composition of second growth forests will not resemble the first growth forests that remained after industrial disturbances. Thus, assessments of forest structure and composition in second growth forests are important and necessary to understand how second growth forests may respond to climate change. Hypothesis: The hypothesis of this research project is that second growth forest communities will not be structurally and compositionally similar to old growth forests, based on the following evidence: (1) regardless of the age of second growth forests, gaps in the forest canopy will be maintained over

Title: A new approach to identify the optimal number of clusters

Author: Richard C. Johnson, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

Date: 2018-04-18

Abstract: A new approach to identify the optimal number of clusters in a data set based on the L2 distance between the cluster centers is proposed. The new approach is compared to the classical Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and the classical Schwarz information criterion (SC). The new approach is shown to have a better predictive power in identifying the number of clusters than BIC and SC.

Keywords: K-means, clustering, BIC, SC, L2 distance.

Background: The L2 distance between the cluster centers is a measure of the overall distance between cluster centers and it is used to define the distance between two clusters. The objective of this work is to propose a new approach to estimate the optimal number of clusters in a data set

The reason for success: There is a positive correlation between redox potential and potential oxidation rate. The redox potential and potential oxidation rate will be highest in the rhizosphere relative to the rest of the water column in open-water sedge sites.
The reason for failure: There is no positive correlation between redox potential and potential oxidation rate. The redox potential and potential oxidation rate will not be highest in the rhizosphere relative to the rest of the water column in open-water sedge sites.

Lecture1
Thawing permafrost is a major concern in permafrost regions as it releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and increases the risk of coastal flooding. The most significant greenhouse gas released from thawing permafrost is methane (CH4), which is 34 times as powerful as CO2. The rate of CH4 release from thawing permafrost soils is uncertain because of a lack of information about the state of the peat in the soils. Recent studies have shown that CH4 release can be reduced by increasing the amount of water in the soils, which can be achieved by increasing the soil water content. However, information about the effects of changes in soil water content on CH4 production rates is lacking. Understanding the effect of changes in

The genetic and molecular pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases is poorly understood. A number of mouse models have been developed in hopes of gaining insight into the mechanisms of neurodegeneration. One such model is the 5XFAD mouse, which expresses five human mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and two in presenilin

A common problem in genomics is to infer the evolution of gene expression. However, due to the noisy nature of microarray data, it is difficult to infer whether the expression of a specific gene has evolved, and if so, how it has evolved. In this paper, we propose a new measure, called {\em differential expression difference}, to quantify

Identify the key words that have the strongest impact on specific features of a student’s transcript and then use these keywords to infer a student’s academic performance.
The inputs are a student’s transcript (i.e., all courses taken by a student and the credits taken by a student), and the outputs are the academic performance of the student.
First, collect the words of the transcript, e.g., words of a course title.
Second, extract the key words from the words that appear the most frequently in the transcript.
Third, identify the keywords that have the strongest impact on specific features of a student’s transcript.
The third step determines the keywords that have the strongest impact on specific features of a student’s transcript, e.g., the keywords that have the strongest impact on the number of credits taken by the student.
Fourth, infer the academic performance of the student by using the keywords.

Abstract: 
The application data of the National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) are used to identify the temporary success of early career scientists. The temporal success of the data was modeled by a two-stage random structure, in which the first stage was the reason for a successful proposal and the second stage was the success of a successful proposal. The first stage was modeled by a discrete choice model, and the second stage was modeled by a random zero-inflated model. The process of the two-stage random structure was tested through simulated data. In the simulation, the information about the reason for success and the success of success was simulated. The two-stage random structure was used to analyze the data of the National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) for the first time. The results show that the two-stage random structure can be used to model the reasons for success. The first-stage model can provide a more reasonable

Their evolutionary success relies on the association between coral animals and symbiotic algae. Corals provide shelter and nutrients for symbionts which in turn supply sugars and O to their hosts2. Corals host symbionts within the symbiosome, an intracellular space 2 defined by the coral-derived symbiosome membrane. This membrane is thought to allow corals to regulate delivery of nutrients to the symbiont but the specific transport mechanisms are mostly unknown. Alarmingly, human-caused ocean warming, acidification, and eutrophication disrupt this symbiosis leading to the expulsion of symbionts (known as ‘bleaching’), decreased coral fitness, and death2. However, the lack of mechanistic knowledge of healthy symbiosis impairs our ability to understand why bleaching occurs, identify resilient and vulnerable species, and design conservation strategies.

SCMP 2
A comparative analysis of the putative role of SCMP 2 in the endocytic iterative cycle in humans and the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii.
INPUT: SCMP2 is a component of the endocytic iterative cycle in humans and is therefore a potential drug target for the treatment of cancer or neurological disorders. There are no known studies of the function of SCMP2 in other species. Since Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that causes brain infection and has a complex life cycle involving both the mammalian and the avian hosts, we hypothesize that SCMP2 is essential for the parasite’s survival and replication in the host. We thus compared the protein structure and the gene organization of the SCMP2 orthologs in T. gondii and humans to identify possible differences that might explain their different functions. 
INPUT: The inputs are the SCMP

Nat Neurosci 2018). Tau pathology is characterized by the accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles comprised of abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau (NFL/Phospho-tau, p-tau) (Goedert et al., Nature 2017, Wang et al. Nat Neurosci 2018). Tau protein is a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) that binds to the microtubule cytoskeleton to promote microtubule assembly and stability (Bolós et al. Nat Rev Neurosci 2017). It also plays a role in intracellular vesicle trafficking and presynaptic neurotransmitter release (Bolós et al. Nat Rev Neurosci 2017). Tau

\section{Results}
Overall, 5 (0.14\%) of the 3,571 proposals submitted to NSF GRFP were awarded the prestigious \textit{award} status, while 277 (7.78\%) of the proposals were awarded the \textit{honorable mention}. This means that the success rate of GRFP is 0.14\% ($\frac{5}{3,571}$) for the \textit{award} status, and 7.78\% ($\frac{277}{3,571}$) for the \textit{honorable mention}. In this section, we present our results for the GRFP classification.

The majority of these indels occur in introns, but indels in exons are also common. In a recent screen for indels in the exons of 87 genes, we identified 11 genes with 2 or more exonic indels in each of at least 2 independent samples. The indels were identified by next generation sequencing of polyadenylated mRNA from 2 independent samples. The indels were named with a unique identifier, and the gene name, the drawing of the gene with the indels, and the sequence (both genomic and mRNA) containing the indels were deposited in the online database GiN. (GiN: http://gin.cse.ucsc.edu/). In this report, we describe the indels in 6 of the 11 genes. We report indels in 5 exons of the gene S

Aim 1: I will develop a novel computational framework for identifying convergent evolution between genomes. I will compute amino acid sequences at each ancestral node in the phylogeny using the linear-time maximum parsimony method implemented in PAML 4 (Yang, Mol Biol Evol 2007). I will identify the set of amino acids that converged in that pair of species with probability>0.9, as well as those that diverged with probability>0.9, based on the ancestral sequences inferred in Step 1. I will report a convergence score for the gene in this pair of species: the ratio of convergent mutations to divergent mutations. I will then report the full distribution of convergence scores for every gene in every species pair, and denote the upper outliers as convergence events. I will measure my framework’s precision

Background: In recent years, there has been an increased interest in the use of molecular modeling techniques in drug design. In particular, the use of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and related molecular modeling techniques has proven to be a useful tool for investigating the structure and dynamics of protein-ligand complexes and the conformational changes associated with ligand binding. In addition, these methods have been effective in studying important issues in drug design, such as identifying potential binding sites and hotspots on proteins, evaluating the binding affinity of ligands, and predicting the structure of active or inactive states of a protein-ligand complex. Molecular modeling has been widely applied to assist in the design of new drugs, and several recent examples include the design of drugs targeting the influenza virus hemagglutinin protein (1), the human beta-2 adrenergic receptor (2), and the HIV-1 protease enzyme

The results are shown in Table 1.

INPUT: Motivation: Hydrogenation is an especially important industrial reaction that finds uses in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, fragrance, and fine chemical synthesis. 10-20% of chemical reactions at Roche (the world’s third largest Biotech company) are catalytic hydrogenations1, and hydrogenation of N to NH consumes an estimated 2% of the world’s energy supply. 2 3 Supramolecular chemistry utilizing adjustable hemilabile ligands that approximate enzymatic activity has been an extremely active area of research, and hydrogenation can be improved significantly with respect to its chemoselectivity by tuning the catalyst to minimize over- hydrogenation. Mirkin et al. have constructed elegant ‘molecular tweezers’ that take advantage of chloride binding and supramolecular interactions to create switchable on/off catalytic turnover2. Miller et al. have recently published a PCN (phosphorous-car

All the above works by using keywords and text mining methods. The proposed method is a combination of natural language processing and knowledge based reasoning. This method is a promising approach to improve the overall success in research proposals. This approach will be applied to a series of research in the area of natural language processing and knowledge based reasoning.

Generating Textual Description for a Disease

01/04/2020 | 0 Comments
Abstract: A disease has many characteristics, and we often need to describe a disease using its characteristics. For example, a doctor may describe a disease using its characteristics, such as nausea, fever, or vomiting. Therefore, it is necessary to generate textual description for a disease. In this study, we propose a neural network-based method to generate a textual description of a disease given its characteristics. Our approach is based on a neural network that uses the characteristics as input, and the textual description as output. This algorithm has been tested on a publicly available dataset of 12,000 cases. The results show that our approach can generate a textual description of a disease.

Introduction: A disease has many characteristics, and

I am not sure where the problem is. Maybe it is due to some packages, or something with the text. But I am sure that it is not related to the LaTeX code. It happens when I paste the code into StackExchange. I am using Google Chrome.

I am not sure why the problem happens, but I can tell you how to fix it. The problem is that with a large amount of text, StackExchange does not display all of it. You can check it by clicking on the "edit" button. If you do this, you will see that there is a lot of text after the closing curly brace, and you can see the problem. You can solve this problem by adding a linebreak after the closing curly brace. You can do this by typing in the text "\end{tabular}" on a new line, and then clicking on "check syntax". You can also do this by using the code "\end

Researcher's profile
Kamakshi Raman
Currently, I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Information Management at the University of California, Berkeley. My research interests lie in human-computer interaction (HCI) and human-centered computing. When I'm not making research plans, I enjoy hiking, playing board games, and trying new foods. I’m excited to be a part of the GRFP community, and to be a part of the broader Berkeley community. I am looking forward to the 2020 cohort of GRFP scholars!

The structure of INPUT is as follows:

- [1], a major gap still exists between the skills of these graduates and the skills needed for industry success [2].
- Two major components of this gap are programming skills (e.g. code style) and computational thinking (e.g. extending algorithms).
- My research will enable teachers to close these gaps by building a toolkit to integrate better-targeted problem types than those currently in use.
- Programming assignments in CS classrooms, primarily code tracing and code writing, lack the granularity to target students’ Zones of Proximal Development (ZPD, i.e. challenging but solvable problems). Code tracing questions involve reading and understanding code, but they may not trigger students’ mental models of concepts because they are tedious or too easy [3, 4].
- Code writing questions are a large leap from code tracing, conflating many programming skills into a single solution (e.g. design, computational thinking, programming, code style)

The arctic sea ice cover is a complex and vital component of the earth system, and the rate of its loss in recent decades has been important to observe and study. In this paper, we apply a novel method to the analysis of satellite-observed Arctic sea ice cover to show that the influence of the changing climate on the sea ice cover is complex, and is likely to continue to be so. We provide a simple graphical representation of the results that is suitable for use in a public forum. We discuss the implications of the results on the reduction of sea ice cover in the Arctic. Our study represents a first step towards building a quantitative method to enable scientists to predict the future evolution of the arctic sea ice cover, and thus the future of human and natural systems in the Arctic. We hope that the results of this study will stimulate further research in this area

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{I}{nvestigators} in the field of Computational Thinking claim that teaching Computational Thinking (CT) is key for educating students for the 21st century economies and professions \cite{craig2016computational}. CT allows students to understand and use fundamental concepts of computer science, such as problem decomposition, abstraction, algorithm design and implementation, and data structures. Emphasis is placed on higher-order thinking skills, such as decomposition, abstraction, and algorithm design, which are often underrepresented in traditional pedagogy \cite{craig2016computational}.

The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) data shows that approximately 50\% of applicants in U.S. Colleges and Universities apply for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) majors. However, the

Example 2: Research Plan for a Synthetic Biology Project (from the SARS-CoV-2 example)

This is an example of a research plan for a synthetic biology project. The inputs are proposals submitted to the NSF ABI FASTER program and this is a overall success classifier to identify whether the applicants will be the Winner or Honorable Mention. 
First, list CLUES (i.e., keywords, phrases, contextual information, semantic relations, semantic meaning, tones, references) for determining the overall SUCCESS of INPUT.
Second, induce a diagnostic REASONING process from CLUES and the INPUT for determining the overall SUCCESS (Limit the number of words to 130).
Third, determine the overall SUCCESS of INPUT as Winner or Honorable Mention considering CLUES, the REASONING process and the INPUT.

INPUT: Within the synthetic biology community, we have learned that to harness the power of biological systems, it is essential to have a deep understanding of the molecular mechanisms that under

INPUT: [1], a major gap still exists between the skills of these graduates and the skills needed for industry success [2]. Two major components of this gap are programming skills (e.g. code style) and computational thinking (e.g. extending algorithms). My research will enable teachers to close these gaps by building a toolkit to integrate better-targeted problem types than those currently in use. Programming assignments in CS classrooms, primarily code tracing and code writing, lack the granularity to target students’ Zones of Proximal Development (ZPD, i.e. challenging but solvable problems). Code tracing questions involve reading and understanding code, but they may not trigger students’ mental models of concepts because they are tedious or too easy [3, 4]. Code writing questions are a large leap from code tracing, conflating many programming skills into a single solution (e.g. design, computational thinking, programming, code style) and supporting a wide space of

\subsection{Classification of overall SUCCESS}
\label{subsection:classification_of_overall_success}
The classification of overall SUCCESS is to determine whether the INPUT is a Winner or an Honorable Mention.
In this classification, the CLUES, REASONING process and the INPUT are used as inputs and the overall SUCCESS is used as the output.
To obtain the CLUES, we have to consider the two related tasks. 
First, we have to identify the keywords, phrases, contextual information, semantic relations, semantic meaning, tones, and references in the INPUT.
Second, we have to build the REASONING process from these CLUES.
Next, we have to determine the overall SUCCESS of INPUT taking the CLUES, REASONING process and the INPUT into account.

The challenge is to develop an algorithm that can determine the overall SUCCESS of INPUT, considering CLUES and REASONING, and the INPUT. The algorithm may be developed using non-neural network methods or neural network methods. The algorithm may be developed using any language, including any natural language, artificial language, or any combination of natural language and artificial language. The algorithm may be developed using any programming language, including any programming language that can be executed on any platform or in any application.

The input, CLUES, REASONING, and output are text. Text is defined as text that is contained within a block of text. A block of text is defined as a block of characters that is delimited by whitespace or a delimiter that is not a whitespace character. A whitespace character is a space, regular tab, or other character that is used for indentation and line breaks. The input is a block of

OUTPUT: Overall SUCCESS: Winner or Honorable Mention

Let us consider a research proposal and a human evaluation as INPUT for understanding the overall SUCCESS process. The research proposal is to develop a new method of a data-driven AI, and the human evaluation is to determine the overall SUCCESS of the proposal as Winner or Honorable Mention. The CLUES are keywords, phrases, contextual information, semantic relations, semantic meaning, tones, references, and they are induced from the research proposal. The CLUES are used for the REASONING process for determining the overall SUCCESS of the research proposal. The REASONING process is represented by a dependency tree diagram for describing the CLUES and the research proposal. The REASONING process is used to determine the overall SUCCESS of the research proposal as Winner or Honorable Mention.

OUTPUT: Success (Winner or Honorable Mention)

The CLUES are composed of keywords, contextual information, semantic relations, semantic meaning, tones, references. The keywords are extracted from the INPUT by using the keyword extraction technique, and then the contextual information, semantic relations, semantic meaning, tones, references are induced from the keywords with the keyword extraction technique. For example, the keywords of the INPUT are “medicine”, “cancer”, “breast cancer”. The contextual information of the keywords is “clinical trials” and “animal study”. The semantic relations are “cause-effect” and “result”. The semantic meaning is “the cause of the breast cancer and the cause-effect of the breast cancer”. The tones of the keywords are “positive” and “negative”. The references of

Step 1: List CLUES

The CLUES are words, phrases, expressions, contextual information, semantic relations, semantic meaning, tones and references. The CLUES are the words, expressions and contextual information which provide an overall SUCCESS of INPUT. The words and expressions are the keywords, phrases and contextual information which make the overall SUCCESS of INPUT. The semantic relations, semantic meaning, tones and references are the words and expressions which make the overall SUCCESS of INPUT. The CLUES are listed as follows to determine the overall SUCCESS of INPUT.

Step 2: Induce a diagnostic REASONING process

The CLUES are the words, expressions and contextual information which provide an overall SUCCESS of INPUT. The REASONING process is the diagnostic process for determining the overall SUCCESS of INPUT considering the CLUES and the INPUT. The REASONING process is induced as follows to determine the overall SUCCESS of INPUT

INPUT: Introduction: The social media platform Twitter is often used to discuss health topics. There is a large pool of tweets where people discuss their experiences with medical treatments and are willing to share their perspectives, especially when it comes to treatments they have not had success with. However, this pool of data is of low quality as it contains a large amount of noise and misinformation. In order to effectively use the information from these tweets, it is important to first filter out the noise and misinformation. Objective: In this project, we aim to develop a model that can filter out tweets containing misinformation and noise. Twitter users often have a very strong personal opinion about certain topics, which can lead to misinformation. For instance, the term

After binding only the functionalized exosomes, the spots will be read for relative fluorescence, which is compared to the standard to determine the concentration of functionalized exosomes. (c) Once a standard is established, a variety of engineering strategies could be tested. The exosomes in each culture medium will be quantified by applying them to the microarray spots and reading relative fluorescence. The microarray will enable comparison of multiple samples in a single experiment. (d) Comparison of results to standard will determine the best conditions for exosome production.

Exosomes are a type of nano-sized extracellular vesicle (EV) naturally produced by cells and released via endosomal fusion with the plasma membrane. Although primarily utilized in the detection of diseases such as cancer, exosomes are increasingly being investigated as a means of drug delivery due to their potential for multi-functional targeting and inherent biocompatibility [1]. A longstanding setback in the study and application of exosomes for therapeutic purposes is the lack of standardized methods with which to isolate, concentrate, and characterize them [2]. Although scientists can functionalize exosomes with targeting molecules and drug payloads, scale-up is limited by the ability to quickly identify favorable processing conditions and thus good manufacturing practices.

Applying Deep Learning Algorithms for Energy and Resource Conservation in Textile Manufacturing

Deep learning (DL) is an artificial intelligence (AI) technique for extracting and learning hidden patterns from the data and for predicting the future values. The goal of this project is to apply the DL algorithms in textile manufacturing to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the textile industry. In the production process of textile products, energy consumption is one of the biggest concerns as it accounts for 30-50% of production cost [1]. The current production process of textile products is mainly based on manual labor and traditional manufacturing technologies, which are inefficient and unsustainable. Machine learning and AI are expected to play key roles in helping the textile industry achieve sustainability by providing more efficient and sustainable solution for the production process. Specifically, this project will focus on developing energy and resource conservation strategies using the DL technology in the textile production process. The energy consumed

2024-05-06 13:31:34 - GPT3-Text-Classification : - INFO: returned results - RESULTS and DISCUSSION: The traditional method to determine the success of a GRF proposal is to run a logistic regression classifier on the text of the proposal.  The logistic regression classifier has an AUC of 0.73.  We are not interested in the overall success classifier, but the precision and recall of the Winner and Honorable Mention classification.  The precision and recall of the Winner classification is 0.50 and 0.29, respectively.  The precision and recall of the Honorable Mention classification is 0.09 and 0.23, respectively.  This shows that the overall success classifier does not work, so we need to develop a new classifier.  We developed two models.  The first model is a classification model, which is a random forest classifier.  The second model is a diagnostic reasoning model, which is Bayesian network classifier.  The random forest classifier has an AUC of 0.64 and the Bayesian network classifier has an AUC

Protein microarrays can be modified to include different antibodies in each spot. The ideal formulation would be one that binds only targeted exosomes. Exosomes express the surface ligands CD9, CD63, and CD81 as unique identifiers from other EVs [3]. Antibody cocktails for these ligands, as well as the expressed targeting molecules, would enable binding of only the desired exosomes— even in the presence of a crude EV sample—while washing away all other materials in solution. I will determine the concentration of each antibody for optimal exosome binding kinetics, which is a function of the desired targeting molecule antibody. The formulation must also be modified to include a solvent material that is suitable for microarray printing but that does not interfere with the antibody-exosome interactions. Once I find the ideal antibody cocktail ratios, I will test the formulation to ensure that it prints appropriately

Régime sans gluten : la maladie coeliaque

Diabète, hypercholestérolémie, maladie de Crohn et insuffisance rénale chez le sujet âgé : les facteurs de risque influencent-ils le bénéfice du régime sans gluten ?

Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy caused by intolerance to dietary gluten. In genetically predisposed individuals, ingestion of gluten leads to an immune response that affects the small intestine and is associated with malabsorption. The disease is associated with osteopenia, anemia, short stature, delayed puberty, small bowel lymphoma, and an increased risk for other autoimmune diseases. Celiac disease is characterized by malabsorption, with a high prevalence of iron deficiency anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency

Title: A Quest to Achieve Women in Science

Abstract: Women in Science is a collaborative project between the Department of Chemistry at Hawaii Pacific University and the University of Hawaii at Manoa. This project is designed to encourage and support the interest of young women in the sciences by providing them with an opportunity to participate in a summer research experience at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The students, who are selected by the collaborating university faculty, work alongside their research mentor in the laboratory over the summer. The project was created to address the low participation of women in the sciences. Women make up a minority of the chemistry, physics, and

\item \textbf{Introduction:}




Tissue engineering has the potential to mitigate the shortage of organ donors by creating custom-tailored organs from the patient’s own cells. The current method of producing tissues involves the use of scaffolds that are generated from biocompatible materials, such as hydrogels, and seeded with cells to form tissue constructs. These 3D scaffolds are intended to replicate the extracellular matrix (ECM) that provides a physical framework to support cells and allow them to communicate through chemical signaling

INPUT: In the past 100 years, the United States has gone from a country with only one automobile to a country with 250 million cars. The automobile has become a part of the American culture and way of life. This has led to an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease and death caused by automobile accidents. In 2010, 32,885 deaths were caused by automobile accidents.1 The ability to use a stem cell to replace damaged vascular tissue or to regenerate new vascular tissue would be a significant advancement, but the lack of endothelial cells in the vascular system has made it difficult to regenerate or repair the vascular system. In order to address this shortage of endothelial cells, there has been research on the use of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) which have been isolated from the peripheral blood.2 EPCs are not only a source of endothelial cells but are also involved in the differentiation of cardiac and other types of cells

Diagnostics: My research objective is to investigate the ability of oxygen-releasing microspheres to decrease cell necrosis for adipose-derived stem cells in printed implants. Using oxygen-releasing polymers to reduce cell death rates for tissue engineering applications has only been referenced in one publication at the time of this application. This system involves a two level approach. First, core-shell microspheres are created with the shell consisting of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and the core containing H O -modified 2 2 poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP). This shell system allows for slow release of H O -modified-PVP 2 2 for up to two weeks.3 Second, the microspheres are then encapsulated in a hydrogel with catalase enzyme and cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs). Catalase reacts with the H O

This wearable ECG sensor is fabricated on a flexible substrate via a simple, low-temperature, and low-cost process, which can be easily integrated into any clothing, e.g., shirt, pants, and even underwear, for long term monitoring. The proposed sensor consists of four polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) composite ink microelectrodes and a microfluidic channel, which are fabricated on a flexible polyimide (PI) substrate by screen printing and inkjet printing. A microfluidic channel is integrated into the skin-contact surface of the sensor to deliver a small amount of saline solution to the skin surface for the ECG signal acquisition. PVA composite inks are used as the microelectrodes ink for the ECG signal acquisition.

Develop a diagnostic RA process for determining the overall SUCCESS of INPUT.
The RA process is a process for determining the overall SUCCESS from CLUES and the INPUT.

CLUES: The big problem is that we have never been able to create the right microenvironments in tissue engineering applications. 
The key to making this work is developing the right microenvironments, and we have several mechanisms in place to do that. 
We can create microenvironments that have the right mechanical properties and the right chemical properties. 
We can also create microenvironments that have the right biological properties. 
By using three different mechanisms, we can create scaffolds that contain the right microenvironments to enable cells to do what they are supposed to do.
We can combine biodegradable and non-biodegradable materials and then take advantage of their different degradation rates.

Solar panels are the most expensive component of a solar energy system. One technique to reduce cost is to improve the efficiency of solar energy conversion. The current state of the art for solar cells is to use two semiconductors, a p-type material and an n-type material, which are connected in series, with the resulting device called a pn junction. The pn junction is made to be very thin, such that light can easily penetrate the device, giving the device a high surface area to volume ratio. The pn junction is made of two semiconductors that are doped to be opposite in charge, such that the internal electric field causes electrons to be pulled from the p-type material and holes to be pulled from the n-type material. The charge carriers are then funneled through a wire that connects the n-type material to the p-type material. The charge carriers travel through the

\subsection{Overall Progress}
\label{subsec:overall_progress}
The goal of this study is to investigate the research area of \emph{wireless power transfer via strongly coupled magnetic resonances}.\footnote{Reflexive Field Containment in Dynamic Inductive Power Transfer Systems, November 2014} The overall progress of this study is as follows.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Stage I: The initial investigations are based on the reflexive field containment compensation approach \cite{reflexive_field_containment_2014}, which achieves field containment by exploiting the receiving coil’s reflected capacitive reactance to neutralize the source coil’s inductive reactance. 
    It is also called reflexive resonance. The source coil’s current is thus attenuated when the coils are uncoupled, thereby reducing emanated fields. 
    The high power multi-coil wireless power transfer system is also called a transformer.

You can't use verbatim in the argument to another command. You need to change the definition of \problem to:

\newcommand{\problem}[1]{\begin{center}
\textbf{#1}
\end{center}}

and then use \problem rather than \begin{verbatim}.

The existing conjugated polymers with excellent performance, however, generally present high band gaps (Eg > 2.5 eV), which are usually difficult to be reduced by simple chain extension. On the other hand, the high Eg often results in the problems in optoelectronic applications due to the low absorption coefficient. To tackle these challenges, we present a rational design for high performance naphthalene diimide (NDI)-based conjugated polymers by a systematic exploration of electronic structure and morphology. By tuning the NDI spacer length, we obtain a series of polymers with Eg of 2.20-1.85 eV. Compared with the well known high performance NDI

Specifically, the role of sea surface temperature (SST) in mediating the effects of other environmental factors on trophic interactions is an important piece of the puzzle. This information is necessary to develop predictive models of food web dynamics in response to climate change. In order to gain a better understanding of the role of SST on food web dynamics, I will measure the responses of primary production and planktonic food webs to changes in temperature on the Strait of Gibraltar, a narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea. Existing research has shown that the hydrographic characteristics of the Strait of Gibraltar create distinct differences between the systems of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.

Authors: Daniel G. Neafsey (The George Washington University), David J. Koepsell (The George Washington University), Christopher Gregg (The George Washington University)
Abstract: This paper describes a novel approach to the analysis of survey data that combines techniques from the field of artificial intelligence, expert systems, and machine learning. Our approach is motivated by the observation that most machine learning techniques are used to make predictions or classifications on data that are already in the form of quantitative variables. However, in social science research, researchers often collect data in the form of survey responses, which are categorical rather than quantitative. In addition, for many social science research questions, the underlying variables in the data are unobservable, and must be inferred from the survey responses. In this paper, we describe an artificial intelligence system that is capable of making these inferences. The system uses a

The overarching goal of my research program is to identify the drivers of recovery following disturbance and how disturbance affects biotic interactions and community dynamics. I focus on the interplay between disturbance and ecosystem functions, specifically how disturbance alters community composition and trophic interactions. I primarily focus on these relationships in the context of tropical streams, as these ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to disturbance, but my research also applies to other aquatic and terrestrial systems. I propose to examine how disturbance affects stream processes and trophic interactions in two ways: (1) by conducting perturbation experiments, and (2) by analyzing historical data from the Luquillo LTER. I chose these two approaches for my proposed research because they are complimentary and highlight my ability to conduct both short- and long

RIO 2: The Effect of Hurricane María on Stream Water Quality in the Rio Espiritu Santo

 

BACKGROUND: The Río Espíritu Santo (RES) is a small coastal stream located in the Luquillo Mountains of northeastern Puerto Rico. The RES is one of two watersheds in the Luquillo Mountains that are part of the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) and the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory (LCZO), which operates under the NSF LTER program and collects long-term stream water chemistry data. The LUQUIHNO (Luquillo Hydrology and Nitrogen Study) was initiated in 2006 and is a collaborative effort among the University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras (UPRRP), University of New Hampshire (UNH), and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The study is located in the largest and most urbanized of three catchments in the LEF, the Río Piedras (R

Introduction: Many species of ants have evolved a complex chemical sensing system that allows them to detect the presence of other ants, food sources, and dangerous predators. This system, called the mandibular chemosensory system, consists of a pair of chemosensory organs, the chemosensory labella, and a pair of chemosensory organs, the antennal sensilla. The antennal sensilla are the primary chemosensory organ of ants, and are responsible for receptor-mediated detection of compounds in the environment. The antennae of ants are highly variable in structure across species. However, there is a general consensus that the antennae are composed of a series of segments called antennomeres. While it is known that the antennae of ants

Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaire’s disease, has only recently become a human pathogen.

Co-evolution within amoeba and horizontal gene transfer has helped shape the near 300 effectors produced by Legionella that are injected into the host cell by the Dot/Icm type IVB translocation system1. A majority of these effectors have eukaryotic-like domains such as: F-box, U-box, Sel-1, ankyrin repeats, leucine- rich repeats, and CaaX motifs, which were likely acquired by horizontal gene transfer2. These domains aid in the hijacking of host processes by L. pneumophila in order to promote growth and replication.

INPUT: Predation of 2 species of tropical cichlids Keywords: trophic cascade, predator-prey, resource polymorphism, speciation, life history, stable isotope analysis

Our goal is to test hypotheses regarding trophic cascade and resource polymorphism in a cichlid community in Lake Tanganyika. Identification of the mechanisms that drive predator-prey interactions has proven to be a major challenge in ecology. The cichlid fish of Lake Tanganyika are an excellent system to study predator-prey interactions. Our lab is part of a long-term collaboration with the University of Minnesota, which has been studying the ecology of the Cichlid community

Memory consolidation is the process by which new memories become stable and thus available for future recollection. Sleep is essential for the consolidation of declarative memory, and most of this research has focused on non-REM sleep. However, many studies have shown that REM sleep is also important for memory consolidation, and that REM sleep after learning can improve memory performance and enhance memory retention. Indeed, brain activity during REM sleep is similar to that during waking, and REM sleep after learning is important for memory consolidation. When people do not have REM sleep, they have poorer memory performance. REM sleep is also important for non-declarative memory consolidation, but this has been investigated much less extensively. Indeed, it

BACKGROUND: The research proposal is to analyze the impact of asparagine hydroxylation on the host and bacterial effectors. The proposal is very broad and it is necessary to narrow down the contents into a specific research focus. The specific research focus is determining the impact of asparagine hydroxylation on the host and bacterial effectors. AIM 1: Hydroxylation of effector proteins. The proposal aims to identify if the HEL proteins of L. pneumophila, YopM of Y. pestis, and IpaH4.5 of S. flexeneri are hydroxylated in human cells.

INPUT: The impact of a parent’s depression on their adolescent’s mental health Keywords: Parental depression, adolescent mental health, substance use, psychiatric disorders, parent-adolescent interactions, family relationships, siblings, children of depressed parents Parents with depression are significantly more likely to have children with mental health problems. The mechanisms that explain this connection are unclear. The proposed study will examine the association between parental depression and adolescent mental health, and if this association is explained by parent-adolescent relationship quality and/or parent-adolescent interactions. The proposed study will also examine whether the presence of a depressed sibling (rather than the parent) explains the relationship between parental depression and adolescent mental health. The proposed study will include 450 adolescents and their parents from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Adolescents will be 15-18 years old at the time of the baseline interview.

Summary: I propose to use multiple imaging systems, such as structural and functional MRI imaging to provide a temporal evolution of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with multi-modal data. It will include patients that show no symptoms and patients that have MCI. This temporal evolution will show how different regions of the brain changes and how AD evolves. The hippocampus region will be a main region of interest, but other regions like the temporal lobe will be examined [2,3]. In addition with the imaging system, looking at the cerebrospinal fluid will provide great insight to how AD affects the body [1]. I will also incorporate GPU computing to make it efficient.

The development of a low-cost, non-invasive method to diagnose Alzheimer's disease at the earliest stages would be valuable for the development of new treatments and slowing the progression of the disease. My research will explore a method that uses an algorithm called Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify patients and healthy controls from Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. It will be evaluated on its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. If successful, this method could be used to screen for Alzheimer's disease, monitor disease progression, and track the effectiveness of new Alzheimer's treatments. I plan to achieve this by conducting a series of studies where I will be collecting EEG data from a cohort of Alzheimer's patients and healthy controls, and processing it using the proposed methods.

\section{The overall classification process}

The overall classification process is summarized in Algorithm \ref{alg:overall}. The inputs are research proposals submitted to NSF GRF applications and this is a overall success classifier to identify whether the applicants will be the Winner or Honorable Mention. 
First, list CLUES (i.e., keywords, phrases, contextual information, semantic relations, semantic meaning, tones, references) for determining the overall SUCCESS of INPUT.
Second, induce a diagnostic REASONING process from CLUES and the INPUT for determining the overall SUCCESS (Limit the number of words to 130).
Third, determine the overall SUCCESS of INPUT as Winner or Honorable Mention considering CLUES, the REASONING process and the INPUT.

Hi,
I've downloaded the dataset and will be having a look at it to see what I can come up with. Do you need the dataset in a specific format or do you have a raw version you can provide?

Hi, I attached the dataset here.

I need your help. :)

Hi, I'm having a look at the dataset now. I see the first problem is that you have 2 different representations for each instance. The first is that the instances are stored as a series of streams of tokens, and you also have a representation where each token is labeled as 'part-of-speech' (POS).

It would be better to have a single representation that contains the instances as a stream of tokens with the corresponding POS labels. But this is not an easy thing to do as we would need to make sure that

In the above example, we will use CLUES to determine the overall success of INPUT. CLUES is a list of words and phrases extracted from INPUT. CLUES includes keywords, phrases, contextual information, semantic relations, semantic meaning, tones, references. In order to determine the overall success of INPUT, we need to induce a diagnostic reasoning process from CLUES and the INPUT. We set a limit of the number of words to 130.

mate. The majority of research regarding the signal function of visual traits has concerned color or patches of color. This focus on charismatic coloration has left unexplored the potential signaling function of achromatic patterns. Some patterns, such as the white check patch of great tits (Parus major) or the black facial spots of female paper wasps (Polistes dominula), have been suggested to function as assessment signals^1. Yet, there is little empirical evidence that females consider patterns when selecting a mate. In the

The overall success classifier is implemented as a pure function (i.e., {\tt Getter}) and it is called as below.

`Getter[results, 0, 2]`

When the overall success of {\tt results} is the Winner, then the output of this function is 2.

As a result, the overall success is Winner ({\tt results[[1]]}) for {\tt results}.

The inputs are research proposals submitted to NSF GRFP. This is a overall success classifier to identify whether the applicants will be the Winner or Honorable Mention.

First, list CLUES (i.e., keywords, phrases, contextual information, semantic relations, semantic meaning, tones, references) for determining the overall SUCCESS of INPUT.

\section{Conclusion}
This paper presents the CLUES of overall SUCCESS of INPUT and a diagnostic REASONING process to determine overall SUCCESS of INPUT based on CLUES and the INPUT. This approach is specific to the research proposals for the NSF GRF and the NSF GRFP. The CLUES can be reused for other success classifiers.

Abstract

Abstract: The zebra finch is a unique estrildid in that it simultaneously exhibits dimorphic carotenoid coloration, barred plumage, and spotted plumage. As a result, it is possible that zebra finches are adept at both color and contrast perception. Other closely related species, such as the long-tailed finch (Poephila acut

OW has severely diminished coral health through increased disease susceptibility and bleaching.3 To fully understand how corals might fare under future OW conditions, the potential for coral acclimatization over generations and life history stages must be assessed. Previous research on coral acclimatization has focused primarily on intra-generational acclimatization (IGA), which investigates if corals can adjust to new conditions within their lifetime. For example, Brown et al. (2002) found that when G. aspera were exposed to higher levels of solar radiation, they were less susceptible to bleaching.4 While IGA is crucial in elucidating coral resilience, the study of trans-generational accl

Nicole R. Kastner, Oregon State University

The cane toad is a large, poisonous, terrestrial frog species native to Central and South America. It was introduced to Australia in 1935 to control pests of sugar cane crops. Since its introduction, the cane toad has spread throughout Australia and the Pacific islands, most notably to the Hawaiian Islands. Toads are usually found around water, like ponds and streams. In the Hawaiian Islands, cane toads have adapted to a unique ecological niche, the lava tube system. Lava tubes are subterranean, mile-long tunnels formed from lava flows. Lava tubes are a common feature of Hawaiian volcanoes, and in Hawai’i, there are 2,000 miles of lava tubes. Hawaiian lava tubes are formed during a flow of lava when the exterior of the lava

Title: Designing a DNA-based Molecular Machine: Deploying an Electronic Circuit in a Living Cell
Authors: Daniel D. Chen, Max M. Woodbury, and Alex R. A. Anderson
Keywords: DNA computing, bioinformatics, molecular machine, molecular engineering
Abstract: In this project, I design and test a molecular machine constructed primarily from DNA molecules. There are distinct advantages to using this molecular architecture: (1) It is scalable, because many copies of the same machine can be produced in parallel; (2) It can be reprogrammed, because the machines can be reassembled using a combination of DNA hybridization and DNA ligation; (3) It is robust, because the recognition of specific DNA target sequences prevents the machines from functioning on any other DNA sequences. In this project, I describe the design of a machine that scans a stretch of DNA and recognizes any sequence of 16 or more

The output is the following:

That is not ideal at all. It is far from ideal to have to reformat the LaTeX code and to have to manually add comments to the LaTeX file to make it work as a single sentence. I have tried the following:

- Using the command \typein [\COMMENT{}]{Comment to add to the code:} after each code line. This does not work.
- Using the package verbatim. It does not work either.
- Using the environment comment. It does not work either.

The only package that works is comment: it simply ignores the whole code and only shows the comment. But this is not what I want. I want the code to be formatted as a single sentence, but to have the comment to be show only if the user wishes so.

The problem is that multicols has to insert page breaks at certain places to accommodate the page length. It tries to work out where it can fit the columns on the page and inserts \clearpage before \begin{multicols} to make sure there is room for the columns. If you want to remove the whitespace you need to tell multicols that it can place the columns on the page anywhere. You can do this by setting the longest column to be the same width as the textwidth.

The input of the WINNER/HONORABLE MENTION classifier is a research proposal submitted to NSF GRF. The output of this classifier is WINNER or HONORABLE MENTION. We have evaluated two methods for this classifier: (1) A semantic information based method and (2) A semantic information based method plus a diagnostic reasoning method. In this section, we discuss the results of the two methods. 

\subsection{Method 1: A Semantic Information Based Method}
In this method, we have applied a semantic information processing method for determining the overall success. The semantic information processing is a diagnostic reasoning process. We determine the success of the research proposal by applying a diagnostic reasoning process to the semantic information associated with the research proposal. In this method, we assume that the semantic information associated with the research proposal is sufficient for determining the overall success.

Keywords: visual processing, brain scanning, brain imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) The primate visual system is a complex and elaborate information processing network that has evolved to be one of the most complex and elaborate in the animal kingdom. Despite decades of research, much remains unknown about how this system operates and how its different components work together to produce our experiences of the visual world. While the field of vision science has made great progress in understanding the basic properties of the primate visual system, it is still unclear how the visual system is organized in terms of function and structure. One of the major goals of my research is to understand how the visual system processes information from the retina to the cortex and back to the brain in order to understand the basic principles of information processing in the visual system.

INPUT: An observational study of the effects of parents' marital status on children's mental health Keywords: marital status, children, mental health, stress This project aims to study the effects of parents’ marital status on children’s mental health. In recent years, the divorce rate has been increasing in the United States, affecting not only the family but also the child. Divorce causes children to have poorer physical health, less self-esteem, and more externalizing or internalizing problems, therefore the divorce rate in our society should be decreased in order to improve children’s mental health. This research will use a longitudinal design as well as standard statistical methods to investigate the effects of parents’ marital status on children’s mental health. In the first half of the twentieth century, 4.3% of children were born to unmarried parents in the United States and 3.5% of children were born out of wedlock in 2010

Introduction Nash equilibrium is a central concept in the study of games. In a game, two or more participants each choose a strategy from a set of available options. An outcome of a game is a tuple of strategies (one for each player) that is a solution to the associated underlying optimization problem. The outcome is defined to be a Nash equilibrium if each player is doing the best that can be done given what the others are doing. An illustrative example is a game where each player is playing a game of chess against an opponent. In this game, each player will choose the chess piece they will move and the square that they will move to; the outcome is a game of chess. The Nash equilibrium is when each player is playing the best move they can given what the other

These words may contain important information, as natural language processing (NLP) has shown that each word has a vector representation with semantic meaning. For example, the word “Tiger” is seen as a predator that attacks its prey such as “Wild Animal” or “Puma” whereas the word “Lion” is related to “King” or “Animal” (i.e., “The King of Animals”). The goal of this project is to use NLP methods to uncover the roles of preceding words in natural language decision making. Background In

Algorithms are the core of all computer science, and can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. Despite the growing importance of algorithms in computing, there is no consistent way to teach them to students. The result is that many students are not being equipped with the fundamental algorithms skills needed to succeed in computer science. Proposal To address this problem, I propose to study and design algorithms for a variety of different types of problems, including the design of algorithms for data-oriented problems. The goal of this work is to develop a data-oriented approach to algorithms that can be used to teach students. By using a data-oriented approach, we can represent many different types of problems as data structures, and develop algorithms that operate on these data structures. The result will be an approach to

The message is usually encrypted, and is therefore undetectable by the naked eye. The least significant bit (LSB) algorithm is a widely known and used technique. In the LSB algorithm, the least significant bits of the pixels in the image are modified. This is done by swapping the least significant bit of the pixel with the least significant bit of the corresponding message. To ensure that the message is not detectable, the LSB algorithm is often combined with an encryption algorithm. Proposal The goal of this project is to make the LSB algorithm more robust to attacks. The LSB algorithm is vulnerable to simple attacks such as flipping pixels. In order to make the LSB algorithm more robust, we need to find a way in which flipping a pixel is not enough to reveal the message. Intellectual Merit This project will have broad

Inference algorithms such as Mean Field Variational Bayes (MFVB) and Stochastic Variational Bayes (SVB) are widely used in parameter learning. However, these algorithms do not construct a model, but rather a distribution over it. It is known that if the model is greedy, i.e. only one variable is non zero at each iteration, then the resulting distribution is a good approximation to the true model. This is an important concept known as the Information Bottleneck (IB) Principle. The main idea of IB is to choose a distribution, and then try to minimize the mutual information of that distribution with the data. In this proposal we want to use neural networks for learning a greedy model, and then use IB to construct

While we know that the presence of diverse functional traits in an ecosystem is directly linked to the successful provisioning of essential services1, it is often easier to quantify an ecosystem’s genetic diversity than to determine its functional diversity. Unfortunately, we lack a fundamental understanding of the interrelationships between these forms of diversity and whether or not one can be used as a proxy for another. This gap in our knowledge impedes our ability to make management decisions that maximize future ecosystem services. • My proposed research will: • 1.

\subsection{Evaluation of the Classifier}
The overall success rate of the classifier is $67\%$ and the precision, recall and F1 score is given by $0.65$, $0.58$ and $0.62$ respectively. The confusion matrix is given in Table \ref{table:confusion_matrix}. The analysis of the confusion matrix indicates that our classifier has a tendency to classify the applications that receive Honorable Mention as Winner. In the following sections, we analyze the proposed method based on the results of the classifier.

Although geographically remote, the Arctic has a significant impact on globally important feedbacks to climate change. Since ozone (O) is the precursor for most of the oxidizing, or self-cleaning, capacity in the 3 troposphere, it generally controls the oxidation potential of the atmosphere. Similar to the discovery of stratospheric ozone depletion, observations of ozone depletion events (ODEs) in the polar boundary layer (BL) were surprising. Springtime episodic depletions of tropospheric O, and the characteristic photochemistry 3 involved, are current areas of considerable research. These sudden and recurrent ODEs during late winter and spring are associated with elevated concentrations of halogenated radicals. The conversion of inert halide salt ions into reactive halogen

Fieldwork will take place over a 3-week period in Barrow, Alaska beginning in the first week of April. During this period, I will observe an Arctic ozone depletion event that takes place in Barrow. The ozone depletion event will be observed using the Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer (CIMS) that was developed and operated by the Shepson lab. The CIMS will be used to observe the production of ozone, bromine, and iodine species. I will also use a wet chemistry lab to analyze the data from the CIMS. Laboratory analysis will be performed in the mass spectrometry laboratory at Purdue University. There, I will use an ICP-MS to analyze samples of Arctic snow that were collected during fieldwork. The snow samples will be analyzed for the presence of iodine and bromine compounds. If an ozone depletion event is not observed in Barrow,

REASONING: 
Arctic ozone depletion events (ODEs) are associated with elevated concentrations of halogenated radicals. Bromine is the primary driver of ODEs. Iodine chemistry is not well understood. Bromine chemistry dominates Arctic ODEs; even small perturbations in the iodine concentration significantly impact the rate of ozone depletion. Bromine chemistry doubles the efficiency of ozone depletion.

REASONING PROCESS: Speaking of halogen chemistry in the Arctic during ozone destruction events, the research proposal of previous researches discovered that although geographically remote, the Arctic has a significant impact on globally important feedbacks to climate change. Since ozone (O) is the precursor for most of the oxidizing, or self-cleaning, capacity in the troposphere, it generally controls the oxidation potential of the atmosphere. Similar to the discovery of stratospheric ozone depletion, observations of ozone depletion events (ODEs) in the polar boundary layer (BL) were surprising.

\textbf{Input:}  \textit{"between a treatment and control group – has come to be understood as the gold standard for scientific settings where the end goal is intervening in some process to achieve a desired end, as in genetic engineering, clinical trials or public policy design. This is for good reason: causal inference is a technique for identifying the precise impact of a given intervention on the target outcome, which is essentially impossible otherwise due to issues of confounding. Nonetheless a number of issues still plague causal inference as a method of inquiry. Perhaps the most important is failure to generalize. We see this everywhere from MPRA estimated gene expression not predicting measured expression in cells [1] to the numerous nudges that work well in laboratories and fail when scaled [2]. Often these issues of generalization are related to a shift in the underlying population tested in the lab and the actual population intervened on. This means there is a deep connection between understanding when we should expect

After the format conversion, the remaining text document is a single paragraph with a length of 130 sentences. Figure 3 shows the text format of the first two sentences after conversion. We can see that the first sentence is a sequence of several sentences, while the second sentence is a simple sentence with only one sentence. This is the level of sentence granularity that is used by the system. We also recognize that the text document is a research proposal submitted to the NSF GRF application. For simplicity, we will use the term “research proposal” to denote the text documents. A research proposal is a document that contains a series of text information with the purpose of supporting individuals to be a Winner or Honorable Mention.

What is CLUES?

CLUES is a method that we have developed to extract content from a research proposal.
The method is comprised of three stages:

Stage 1: Identify key terms, phrases, contextual information, semantic relations, and semantic meaning of a research proposal. 
Stage 2: Generate the reason for the success of the proposal based on the extracted key terms, phrases, contextual information, semantic relations, and semantic meaning. 
Stage 3: Determine the overall success of the proposal based on the generated reason.

Stage 1

During Stage 1, we identify key terms, phrases, contextual information, semantic relations, and semantic meaning of the research proposal.
The first stage is a three-tiered process (as depicted in Figure 1):

Tier 1: Identify key terms and phrases. 
Tier 2: Identify contextual information. 
Tier 3: Identify semantic relations and semantic meaning.

2024-05-06 13:43:43 - GPT3-Text-Classification : - INFO: returned results -     LysM domain-containing proteins (LYMs) comprise a large group of plant proteins, many of which are involved in plant immunity. They are characterized by the presence of at least one LysM domain, which is a protein-binding domain for diverse ligands, such as peptidoglycan (PGN) in bacteria, chitin, and glucans in fungi. Therefore, LYMs are thought to mediate the recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), which subsequently trigger the plant immune response. The recent advances in genome and transcriptome sequence analysis have revealed that LYMs are present in many plant species. However, the functions of LYMs in plants remain largely unknown. We identified a group of LYMs in the whitefly Bemisia tabaci genome. Most of these BtLYMs are predicted to have no obvious motifs other than the LysM domain. To study the functional role of BtLYMs, we performed a yeast two-h

Unraveling the process of polysaccharide utilization in complex bacterial ecosystems
Intellectual Merit – Introduction: Bacteria do not exist in isolation in nature; they form complex communities in which they must recognize, compete over, and, share nutrient resources.1,2 The gut microbiome is an ideal model to study this type of ecosystem, as we know what nutrients these bacteria are exposed to and have access to powerful tools to study taxonomy and metabolism. Gut bacteria break down polysaccharide nutrients and convert them to health-beneficial end products of metabolism called short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that are taken up and used for energy by host intestinal cells.1,2 However, there is a gap in our understanding of what factors give rise to the emergent phenomenon of SCFA production. The leading hypothesis in the field is that communities that fail to respond to a given polysaccharide lack certain “keystone species” that are integral to metabolism.1

To begin, we characterized the surface charge of two enveloped viruses (influenza A, H1N1 and herpes simplex virus type 1 [HSV-1]) and two non-enveloped viruses (adenovirus and poliovirus) using our recently developed chemical force microscopy (CFM) method8. We functionalized our AFM probes with charged (lysine, PKH) or hydrophobic ligands (octyl, HOPG) and measured the adhesion at different pHs in the presence of the viruses. At pH 7.4, HSV-1 had the highest adhesion (Fig. 2A), which is consistent with the literature9 and our recently published results6. Adhesion was reduced by a factor of 10 to

INPUT: Motivation: We have developed a novel platform for measuring the structure and dynamics of individual nanoparticles at liquid-liquid interfaces using chemical force microscopy (CFM). CFM is a sensitive nanoscale force measurement technique that is compatible with various surface chemistries and has been used to detect interactions between nanoparticles, polymers, and biomolecules. The adsorption of nanoparticles to surfaces is critical in many technological and biological applications. In this work, we explore the fundamentals of the interaction between nanoparticles and surfaces using CFM. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the adhesion force between nanoparticles and probes with specific surface chemistries can be used to measure the contact angle between the nanoparticles and a surface. Experimental Plan: We first immobilized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on a gold surface using a layer-by-layer assembly protocol.

1. Motivation
Motivation: The small numbers of African American, Native American and Latino students receiving doctoral degrees in biomedical engineering (BME) contrasts with the diversity of the U.S. population and the importance that this group will play in the future of the field. In 2014, the proportion of U.S. citizens and permanent residents in BME who were African American, Native American, and Latino was 5%, 1%, and 6%, respectively, which does not reflect the population of the United States. The limited diversity in the field is of concern because the underrepresentation reduces the ability of the discipline to address the health needs of all populations and contributes to the isolation of underrepresented minority students in graduate school. The NSF-funded BME Bridge Project is a graduate training program for underrepresented minority students in biomedical engineering (URM-BME) that addresses the high

Have a look at this answer which deals with the same issue, but for the align environment instead of enumerate. The trick is to define a custom environment which you can then use in your enumerate environment. Show your MWE and explain how your enumerate environment is different from the one in my answer and I can try to help you further. – user31729 Jan 14 at 14:32

A different approach, as depicted in Figure 2, categorized the success of the GRF applicants into two main categories: Winner and Honorable Mention. The purpose of the model is to assess whether the applicant will be awarded the GRF Winner or Honorable Mention. This model was developed from the keywords, phrases, and contextual information of the GRF proposals and the success of the applicants. Figure 2 shows the overall framework of this model. The inputs are the list of CLUES (i.e., keywords, phrases, contextual information, semantic relations, semantic meaning, tones, references) for determining the overall SUCCESS of INPUT, and the INPUT. The CLUES were obtained from the NSF GRF application, which contained a list of keywords, phrases, and contextual information. The CLUES were also obtained from the semantic relations, semantic meaning, and tones of the INPUT and the CLUES. The semantic relations were obtained from WordNet, which was a database of English words that were organized into

Evaluation of the success is a major challenge in the field of natural language processing (NLP).
Machine learning has been widely used in this field. 
There are two types of evaluation. 
The evaluation that is based on supervised machine learning (SML) is called a supervised evaluation.
The evaluation that is based on unsupervised machine learning (UML) is called an unsupervised evaluation.
The evaluation based on both supervised and unsupervised machine learning is called a hybrid evaluation.
The results of the GRF applications are evaluated based on the SML classifier. 
The results of the GRF applications are evaluated based on the UML classifier.
The results of the GRF applications are evaluated based on the hybrid classifier.

Classification Accuracy: 
The classification accuracy is the ratio of the number of correctly classified cases to
the total number of cases.
The classification accuracy is 76\%.

2024-05-06 13:45:13 - GPT3-Text-Classification : - INFO: returned results - Motivation: Virus purification and concentration is critical for the production of vaccines and gene therapy vectors. Today, vaccines exist for 26 viral diseases1, but low yields and high costs of production prevent access to many vaccines. Similarly, production limitations will reduce access to viral gene therapy, which may provide cures to single-mutation genetic diseases. Although many technologies exist for virus particle purification, they each face unique roadblocks to developing rapid, high-yielding, and ultimately continuous processes. Chromatography is widely-used for virus purification, but suffers from low binding capacities, frequently inactivates viruses, and cannot operate continuously. Ultrafiltration is readily scalable and provides high throughput and recoveries, but fouling reduces flux and removal of contaminating proteins is often ineffective. Ultracentrifugation is difficult to scale up and has low yield, even though purities are high. Aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS), most commonly constructed with two polymers or a polymer and a salt, are

The analysis of the CGM of high-z galaxies will be conducted using optical and NIR spectroscopy obtained with Keck+MOSFIRE and NIRCam on JWST. The neutral fraction of the IGM will be determined using Lyα and CIII] emission-lines in the NIR. The CGM will be analyzed using CIII] emission-lines. The metallicity of the CGM will be analyzed using the CIII] emission-lines. The proposal will thereby address key outstanding questions about the properties and ionization state of galaxies during reionization (z = 6-10), as well as the properties of the neutral IGM and the CGM of galaxies during the epoch of reionization, and the evolution of

The proposed research will determine the impact of reionization on the properties of galaxies at z=6.5-8.0 by measuring the Lyα and CIII] emission of high-z galaxies. The measurement of CIII] will also be used to measure the ionization state of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and ionized IGM surrounding galaxies. The proposed research will also determine the distribution of high-z galaxies that contributed to reionization by measuring the Lyα escape fraction and distribution of these galaxies. Lyα is a very useful probe of the ionized intergalactic medium (IGM) during the EoR (Erb et al. 2014, Stark et al. 2015). The Lyα emission lines of galaxies are red

INPUT: Intellectual Merit What is it that you enjoy about your research? One of the most fundamental questions that scientists try to answer is whether or not we are alone in the universe. This is a question that has been asked for millennia and the answers to this question have evolved over time. Based on the data that we have from the past few decades, it has become clear that the universe is expanding. This expansion is believed to be described by the cosmological model known as Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM). The LCDM model is the gold standard for both cosmology and astrophysics. The Lambda in the LCDM model is a parameter that describes the effect of dark energy on the expansion of the universe. Dark energy is believed to be responsible for the accelerating expansion of

The original inputs of the first two examples are the same, but the outputs of the two examples are different. The first example is the overall SUCCESS of INPUT as a Winner, while the second example is the overall SUCCESS as an Honorable Mention. These two examples are the same as the examples in the first section. The only difference is the inputs and outputs. The reason for this difference is that the difference in the results of the outputs is the result of the difference in the selection of clues.

Conclusions

In this paper, we propose a framework based on CLUES to diagnose the overall SUCCESS of INPUT. The results of the experiments show that CLUES can effectively predict the overall SUCCESS of INPUT. We have also pointed out that the feature of the proposed model is not only the clues but also the reasoning process. From the results of the experiments, we believe that the model is suitable for the research of the overall SUCCESS of INPUT. With the help of the proposed model,

This is an example document for CLUES, a content analysis system for full-text documents. CLUES reads a TEX document and generates a CLUES document by recognizing the input keywords (i.e., keywords, phrases, contextual information, semantic relations, semantic meaning, tones, references) of the input document. The CLUES document contains the recognized keywords with the semantic meaning. The recognized keywords are extracted from the input document and are listed as a list of CLUES. The semantic meaning of the keywords is defined. The CLUES document can be used to generate a summary of the input document. The summary is composed of the CLUES. The CLUES document can be used for document clustering purposes.

CLUES uses a custom-made word tokenizer by splitting the input document into words. The tokenization is

The HSC survey is a major step in observers’ ability to optically image BCG outskirts out to 100kpc given its high-quality seeing conditions and a depth 3-4 magnitudes deeper than the SDSS. In collaboration with the HSC team, I will use these data to develop a new technique for extrapolating stellar mass profiles of high-mass BCGs beyond their observable radius by testing them against a sample of simulated, mock-observed TNG galaxies of similar mass. I will use Hydrotools to extract complete stellar and DM profiles from halos in TNG to investigate the connection between the ICL edge and the splashback radius. I will analyze

INPUT: Intellectual Merit Microscopy has long been a powerful tool for the study of biological systems, a field of study known as microscopy. Microscopes provide a way for scientists to see what is happening inside the cell. The use of microscopy is important in the study of biology, as it helps scientists to better understand the inner workings of living organisms. There are a variety of types of microscopes. The type of microscope used depends on the objective of the experiment. The most common type of microscope is the optical microscope. Optical microscopes use visible light to observe specimens. One of the advantages of optical microscopy is that it does not require special equipment to operate. Unlike other kinds of microscopes, an optical microscope can be used by anyone and doesn’t require any special training. However, there are limits to the amount of detail that can be seen using an optical microscope. The magnification of an optical microscope is limited by

The application of statistics and machine learning methods to model the brain connectivity in the context of the mind-body relationship. This research will be driven by a neuroimaging EEG study to investigate the relationship between the consciousness of the mind and the electrical activity of the brain. The proposed study will also elucidate how the brain waves of mind-body relationship can be correlated with the physical and mental health problems of the subjects.
The inputs are the EEG data from the study and this is a categorization classifier to identify which of the subjects have the mind-body relationship. 
First, extract the features for each EEG channel.
Second, induce a diagnostic REASONING process from the features and the EEG data for assigning the mind-body relationship to the subjects.

INPUT: Motivation: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows non-invasive measurement of real-time brain activity in humans. The success of this technology has been evidenced by its rapid growth in popularity in the 25 years of its existence, resulting in nearly 40,000 research papers^1. A large portion of these studies investigates the correlational structure of the brain signal, known as functional connectivity (FC). FC studies are most often implemented in resting state fMRI (RS-fMRI). Historically RS-fMRI has been especially useful in clinical and developmental imaging because it requires no task demands, avoids performance confounds and measures network connectivity in largely the same way that task fMRI does^2. These methods have led to many groundbreaking findings in brain science that were previously inaccessible. Recent evidence^3 has shown that many of these findings may be spurious

There is an easy way to do this using the term-lists package: A list of terms can be defined using

\newtermlist{name}{list of terms}

and then used to automatically generate the list using

\termlist{label}{name}

This package is designed for use in scientific reports, but it works well for this purpose too. Here's a quick example:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{term-list}

\newtermlist{name}{Motivation, Aims, Broader Impacts}

\termlist{mylabel}{name}

Examine the effectiveness of a modified version of the Inquire Within curriculum on students’ science knowledge and critical thinking skills. Inquire Within is a hands-on, inquiry-based science curriculum that emphasizes the scientific method and encourages critical thinking. It is designed to be used in a variety of settings, but I have modified the curriculum and will test it in my own middle school classroom. My goal is to determine if the Inquire Within curriculum is an effective way to teach science and to identify areas for improvement. Inquire Within provides a framework for the scientific method that can be adjusted to match the level of students’ scientific knowledge and critical thinking abilities. The exercises ask students to develop hypotheses, test those hypotheses using the scientific method, and then use their results to decide whether their original hypothesis was correct or incorrect. The curriculum is structured so that students become more adept at the scientific method as they progress through the lessons. The lessons include a variety of activities that

Data Science Methods for the Diagnosis of Advanced Prostate Cancer using PET-CT Images

Abstract:Diagnosis of prostate cancer is very important and requires complex methods. The methods of diagnosis include imaging, biopsy, and histology. For the diagnosis of prostate cancer, the imaging method is one of the most commonly used methods. Imaging methods include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) [1]. Both of them have limitations. MRI can provide excellent spatial resolution, but the sensitivity is not high. PET provides excellent sensitivity, but the spatial resolution is poor. PET-CT, which combines PET and CT, is the most commonly used method in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. PET-CT can provide excellent sensitivity and spatial resolution. In order to improve the diagnosis performance of

The problem is that I'm not able to use the \begin{document} command correctly. I get the error "Missing \endcsname inserted." when I try to compile the .tex file.

Thank you in advance!

You need to remove the blank line after the \begin{document} line:

\begin{document}

should be

\begin{document}

With modern TeX engines, you can also use \begin{document}{...} which will prevent the compilation error, but the blank line will still be inserted.

We propose a multi-view extension of the recently proposed knowledge graph embedding (KGE) method (Kempe et al., 2014) and an unsupervised language model that exploits its learned word representations. We show on the Amazon Product Review Corpus and the Stanford Sentiment Treebank that the proposed unsupervised language model obtains state-of-the-art performance on sentiment analysis and aspect extraction tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that multi-view KGE is an effective method for learning contextualized word representations that benefit from rich knowledge graph structures. 1

CRISPR/Cas9 and geminiviruses will be used to produce knock-ins of advantageous alleles in the homologous native location in the Kitaake background. Alleles selected will belong to the haplotype associated with the highest significance SNPs from the most drought tolerant accessions. Useful variation may exist in promoters, genes, or non-coding sequences. This variation will be leveraged using the high replication rates of geminivirus replicons to increase rates of homology-directed repair, with precise positioning enabled by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated double-stranded breaks9.

What I would like to do is to obtain the same output but with the possibility to highlight and search the text to find specific terms. I imagine it might be possible with a PDF viewer that can do some kind of search in a PDF (like Foxit Reader) but I'm not sure, and I don't know how to do it.

Any help or hint would be appreciated.

Thanks

It is not related to PDF or LaTeX. The simple answer is that you can't have both. – Martin Schröder Jul 30 '13 at 16:39

Welcome to TeX.SE! This is a very tricky problem with many ways to approach it. I'm not sure if this is really a duplicate of the question you link to, which is about a simple example. The best way to approach this is to break it down into parts (I suggest starting with a single input line to begin with), and then try to solve them one at a time. – G. Poore May 7 at 14:23

Note that the keywords are obtained by looking at the training data. The process of identifying keywords is an important part of the process. The keywords are determined based on the wording of the problem statement, and the long tail is pretty well covered. The results of this iterative process are then used to train the classifier. The result is a classifier that can make predictions based on the text. In my research, I have found that the classifier is able to accurately identify the overall success of an NSF GRFP application.

The output of the classifier is a set of textual keywords. These keywords are then used as a starting point for a diagnostic reasoning process. In this process, the keywords are mapped to concepts in the knowledge base that are related to the success of the application. The concepts are then mapped to diagnostic reasoning rules. The reasoning rules are used to determine the overall success of the application. In this manner, the classifier and the diagnostic reasoning process are used together to determine the overall

The diterpenoid precursor for taxadiene, geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP), is necessary for a heterologous taxoid biosynthetic pathway but is produced in insufficient quantities in yeast due to competition for steroid synthesis with farnesyl diphosphate. I will introduce heterologous genes from the Sulfolobus acidocaldarius GGDP synthase instead of the native GGDP synthase from Taxus for improved production of GGDP and taxadiene as there is no competition for steroid synthesis. Introduction of genes from S. acidocaldarius also results in substantial production of geranylgeraniol, further increasing

Neural architecture search for the detection of human faces 
Yun Ji , Jihyun Lee , Hyunwoo Choi , Sang-Won Lee , and Insung Ihm 

Abstract

The human face is a unique and dynamic object and it is important to detect faces everywhere. In this work, we propose a neural architecture search method for the face detection. The proposed method consists of two steps. First, we train the CNN for the face detection and extract feature maps from the trained CNN. Second, we use the extracted feature maps to search for the efficient neural network architecture for the face detection. The proposed method shows the improvement in the performance in the face detection.

Input: Feature maps of the CNN and labels of the face
Method: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for the Efficient Neural Network Architecture for the Face Detection
Result: Efficient Neural Network Architecture for the Face Detection

INPUT: Feature maps of the CNN

Energy intensity declined by 33% between 1973 and 2014, and energy consumption grew by only 1.5% during the same period, despite a 68% increase in GDP. These improvements occurred despite a 43% growth in energy-demanding activities, such as transportation. The majority of this reduction in energy intensity can be attributed to regulations and standards introduced by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) of 1975 requires DOE to regulate the energy efficiency of household appliances. The Appliance Efficiency Regulations (AER) program has been responsible for 65% of the reduction in energy intensity during the past 40 years. In the past, DOE regulations focused primarily on

The most common method for the synthesis of such compounds is through the use of a tethered carboxylic acid ester. Unfortunately, this method does not provide access to all possible tethered carboxylic acids. Moreover, this method produces a large number of byproducts that must subsequently be removed. For example, the synthesis of 3-butoxy-2-hydroxy-5-oxo-4-pentenoic acid, shown

Selective and efficient publication of research results has historically been a desirable standard for the scientific community. Yet, in the past few years, a flood of publications in the form of preprints and social media posts has overwhelmed the system, leaving scientists with too much information to sift through. The quality of scientific studies is thus a major concern, with the need for quantitative methods to assess and optimize the quality of scientific publications. Quality control in academic journals is technically challenging. In addition to the issue of large numbers of submissions, the existing quality control systems are based on subjective evaluations, as a result of which many high-quality papers are rejected, while others are accepted. We develop quantitative methods for the assessment and optimization of the quality of scientific papers. We focus on two important aspects of the quality of scientific papers: the influence of the journal in which the paper is

Introduction

CS: In this work, we focus on a particular dataset from the field of knowledge graph (KG) completion. The dataset consists of 1 024 755 triples consisting of items of various types (e.g., movie, actor, director, etc.) along with beliefs about the relations between items (e.g., whether a given actor is in a given movie). The task is to predict the missing relation of an item given the context of item’s relation type and its neighbors in the KG. Previous methods for this task can be divided into two main categories: rule-based (e.g., deductive rules) and learnable methods. The latter one can be further divided into matrix factorization-based methods (e.g., matrix factorization) and deep-learning-based methods (e.g., graph neural networks). Despite the success of the deep-learning-based methods, they still suffer from the following

The main goal of the project is to create a tool that allows to analyze the information contained in a document and to transform it into diagrams of activities and/or events that describe the activities or events mentioned in the document. The transformation of the information contained in a document into diagrams or graphs is called ontology or semantic classification of the document.

The main objective of the project is to conduct an analysis of the activities and/or events contained in the documents considered, and to transform that information into diagrams of activities and/or events that describe those activities or events. To this end, I propose the use of an ontology that supports the semantic classification of documents and that allows the creation of diagrams for each document in the corpus. This ontology will be based on the work of Open Lexicon and the UMLS ontology. This ontology will be modified to support the creation of diagrams of activities and/or events.

The support for the creation of the diagrams will be based on the use of the framework of diagrams of

In this article, the author uses the NSFG dataset to study the influencing factors of women's childbirth and the effects of the proportion of women who have received higher education on the birth rate. After testing by the Lasso algorithm, it is found that, in general, the higher the proportion of women who have received higher education, the lower the birth rate of women and the factors that influence the birth rate are mainly the number of live births and the age of the women. In the end, the author put forward some policy measures to reduce the birth rate of women and some suggestions for future research.

This work is a research on the influence of mobile phone text messages on young people's health. The research uses the data collected by this work and uses the

Future Impact: 1) This research will contribute to the translation of rodent-to-human research by examining how sustained and event-evoked engagement with memory encoding influence the overall effect of agency on memory. 2) This research will elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying motivated learning, which may support the development of new teaching methods which incorporate choice-based learning. 3) The proposed research will directly test how agency can affect motivation and learning at various timescales, which will contribute both to our understanding of how it can support learning and how we may utilize it to broadly enhance teaching methods.

We have presented the overall success of the application for NSF GRF by building the diagnostic reasoning model. We also discussed the prerequisite knowledge to identify the success of the application and the difference between success and failure in the application. This research will be extended to the other application (such as NCUR, NSF, and GEM) to help to determine the success of the application. This research will be continued in the future to build the diagnostic reasoning model and understand the success of the application. In the future, we will expand the research to the other fields of social science such as education, psychology, and sociology.

Abstract: We propose a method for improving the efficiency of the simulation-based search algorithm, which is the state-of-the-art method for solving the combinatorial optimization problems. Our method combines the advantages of the sampling-based and the optimization-based methods. The core of our method is to use the fast simulation-based search algorithm to explore the search space and determine the candidate solutions, and then use the optimization-based method to efficiently search for the global optimum of the candidate solutions. This method is easy to implement and can significantly speed up the search process. We have tested our method on the test problems and compared it with the baseline algorithm. The experimental results show that our method is significantly more efficient in terms of the computational time, and the quality of the results is comparable to the baseline algorithm.

Parenting has, in fact, been identified as the strongest predictor of anxiety, with inconsistent findings for genetic effects on anxiety. In addition, parenting has been shown to moderate genetic effects on anxiety. Parenting is a highly dynamic process that is associated with specific behaviors that serve as positive or negative reinforcers. It is possible that parenting behaviors are differentially associated with anxiety development in youth. It is important to consider parenting behaviors in the development of anxiety, particularly as parenting behaviors are modifiable. Hypothesis: I hypothesize that parenting behaviors will be associated with the development of anxiety and that these associations will vary as a function of children’s genetic risk for anxiety. Aim 1: To determine whether specific parenting behaviors (i.e., positive and negative reinforcement) are associated with the development of anxiety in youth. Aim

I am a PhD student in the Department of Psychology at Princeton University. I am currently studying how energetic and informational costs shape vocal development in marmoset monkeys. Specifically, I study how energetic and informational costs affect the day in which marmoset monkeys transition from an immature to a mature vocalization. I am inter- ested in how energetic and informational costs are organized in the brain. My previous work in vocal development is published in Animal Cognition (Takahashi et al., 2017). I have also investigated the effect of energetic costs in vocal development in a more general way

However, I don’t know why I make it, what’s the underlying reason about it and how it affects my future. If I could know the reason behind my decisions, I could understand how to make better decisions and how to manage the uncertainty involved. This can be challenging for me to know the reason behind my decisions as I don’t have the past data for my decisions. It is also a complex problem to know the reason behind my decisions as I don’t know the probability of the decision to be wrong or right. I would like to be able to manage the uncertainty involved in my decision making process. Hypothesis: Uncertainty involved in decision making can be determined for a particular decision based on the past data.

The common cold is caused by the rhinovirus, which is a single-stranded RNA virus, and is the most common cause of acute respiratory infections. While there are currently no vaccines or antiviral drugs available for the treatment of the common cold, there are two antihistamines that are available: chlorpheniramine and diphenhydramine. Chlorpheniramine is an H1 histamine receptor antagonist, which binds to H1 receptors on the cells of the respiratory tract and prevents histamine from binding to them. Histamine is a chemical that is released during an allergic reaction, and it is responsible for several symptoms of the common cold, including

\section{The proposed system}
\label{sec:system}

The model proposed in this paper can be divided into two main parts: the first part is the input and the second part is the proposed reasoning system. The input is the candidate text of the research article. The proposed system takes the candidate text as input and outputs the text with semantic relations and tones of the text. Figure~\ref{fig:system} shows the system diagram of the proposed system. The proposed system starts with a preprocessing process to clean the text and then the input is sent to the tonality extractor and semantic relation extractor. The tonality extractor extracts the tonality of the input text and the semantic relation extractor extracts the semantic relation of the input text. These extracted tonality and semantic relation are then sent to the semantic analyzer to generate the semantic relation and tonality of the input text. The semantic analyzer uses the extracted tonality and semantic relation to generate the

INPUT: Title: The effects of environmental enrichment on the gut microbiome of captive zoo mammals Background: The gut microbiota is a community of microorganisms that lives in the gastroin- testinal tract. Within this community, there are beneficial bacteria that aid in digestion and immune function. The gut microbiota has been shown to be significantly influenced by the environment. In particular, there are studies that show the gut microbiota is influenced by the social environment (i.e. the company the animal is living in) and the physical environment (i.e. the enclosure). Our project focuses on the effects of environmental enrichment on the gut microbiota of zoo mammals. Environmental enrichment (EE) is a concept whereby animals are given the opportunity to engage in natural behaviors and in activities that promote mental and physical well being. Enrichment is also beneficial to the mental health of the animals, and is often used as a behavior modification technique in zoo animals. Previous studies have shown that social enrichment can

  4.4.4. A poem

  In this section, we will use the poem \emph{The Waste Land} by T.S. Eliot as an example. The poem was first published in 1922 and the author won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1948. The poem is divided into five sections and it is a collection of diverse texts and poems. The poem is in the public domain (i.e., no copyright).
The poem is mainly about the modern life of the people and the suffering in the society. We will use this poem to demonstrate how to use the \verb|annotation| environment for adding notation to the poem. We will also use the \verb|book| environment for demonstrating the display of the lyrics of the poem.

How these costs are traded-off during development has not been considered, yet it could provide a common, high- level framework across species within which low-level mechanistic findings may be interpreted.
I propose to investigate whether a model that considers energy and information trade-offs best predicts the shape of vocal developmental trajectories in mammals; I will then test the model’s predictions with empirical data.

Is there a way to fix this? I've looked around for similar issues, but I haven't found anything yet. I have tried to use the \hfill command to add more space between the text and the tables, but that didn't really work out. Thanks in advance for the help.

You can add a \vspace*{5mm} command after the final table.

When you say "the device produces pro-inflammatory neutrophils", do you mean that the neutrophils in the model are somehow different from those in the real world? – tim Jul 16 '17 at 18:19

@tim I think the question is that we already know that neutrophils in the device are pro-inflammatory, but the authors want to know why. – Ruslan Jul 16 '17 at 18:37
I think the "the objective of my research" is to create a model that produces pro-inflammatory neutrophils. The text and figures are giving an overview of how the model is built. – user2289 Jul 16 '17 at 19:03

Perceptions of the Future of Health Care

by Mallory Kelly, University of Notre Dame

ABSTRACT

Health care has been a major topic of conversation in the United States for some time now. With the future of Obamacare still in question, many people are wondering what the future of health care looks like. This study examines the perceptions of health care held by undergraduate students, and how those perceptions may change with education. A survey was given to undergraduate students at the University of Notre Dame. The survey included one open-ended question and several Likert-scale questions. The question asked was “What is your definition of health care?” and several questions explored students’ definitions and perceptions of the following topics: health care as a basic human need, health care as a privilege, and health care as a business. The results of this study show that undergraduate students at the University of Notre

Neutrophils (PMN) are the perpetrators of this excessive inflammation, making them a target of therapeutics and motivating the study of mechanisms driving their pro-inflammatory conditioning. In vivo models are insufficient due to significant differences in the function of inflammatory mediators and disease phenotype.

A Comprehensive Approach to Improving Prediction of Climate Change Impacts on the Hydrologic Cycle

Hydrological systems are affected by climate change in many different ways. For example, future climatic conditions are projected to change the frequency of extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts. It is well known that climate change has a significant impact on the global hydrologic cycle. However, past studies have often focused on specific aspects of the hydrologic cycle, such as precipitation or evapotranspiration. With the goal of improving prediction of climate change impacts on the hydrologic cycle, this work proposes a comprehensive approach to understanding the effects of climate change on the hydrologic cycle. The proposed approach is based on the framework of the Global Energy and Water Exchanges (GEWEX) Continental-scale International Project (GCIP). The key idea of this framework is the separation of precipitation and evaporation into two independent processes, and this

Authors: Brianna Marie Torres, Kevin D. O'Gorman, and Michael O. Oborne
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida
Poster ID: 1080
Abstract:
In this research, we investigate the use of natural language processing for the classification of implicit gender stereotypes in NSF applications. This research is motivated by a rising concern for gender bias in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Stereotypes are tightly linked with biases and the assessment of gender stereotypes can provide a tool for identifying implicit gender bias. We focus on the detection of gender stereotypes due to the larger volume of research related to gender bias in the context of gender stereotypes. However, the methods described in this research can be used in other contexts, such as other types of bias (e.g., racial bias). We present three classification

These proteins are critical for development as well as for normal homeostasis, but dysregulation of TF activity can lead to disease states. Anoikis, the process by which cells detach from their extracellular matrix and undergo apoptosis, is important for tissue development and homeostasis. Anoikis pathways are disrupted in many cancers, and overexpression of ETS-binding TFs is associated with metastasis, tumor recurrence, and poor prognosis. In particular, the p100/105 ETS-related TF (ERF) Ets2 is overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and associated with poor prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Coral reefs provide services totaling $10 trillion despite covering only ~0.3% of the ocean floor1. Their evolutionary success relies on the association between coral animals and symbiotic algae. Corals provide shelter and nutrients for symbionts which in turn supply sugars and O to their hosts2. Corals host symbionts within the symbiosome, an intracellular space 2 defined by the coral-derived symbiosome membrane. This membrane is thought to allow corals to regulate delivery of nutrients to the symbiont but the specific transport mechanisms are mostly unknown. Alarmingly, human-caused ocean warming, acidification, and eutrophication disrupt this symbiosis leading to the expulsion of symbionts (known as ‘bleaching’), decreased coral fitness, and death2. However, the lack of mechanistic knowledge of healthy symbiosis impairs our ability to understand why bleaching occurs, identify resilient and vulnerable species, and design conservation strategies. The mechanisms that

I graduated from the University of California Davis in 2016 with a BS in Environmental Biology and Computer Science. My research focuses on increasing our understanding of coral-algal symbiosis, a relationship that is critical for coral survival under ocean warming and acidification. I am particularly interested in studying coral proteins that regulate nutrient delivery to symbionts and how they respond to environmental stress. My previous research experience includes studying the role of coral proteins in coral bleaching. Currently, I am working on a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project with Dr. N.

What does the documentclass "article" do?

article is the standard LaTeX document class for articles. It provides a title page, sections, subsections, lists, tables, figures, footnotes, labels, cross-references and more. The documentclass article is based on the book class, which was designed for books. It provides a better layout for books than article. However, for papers article is the better choice. It is much easier to prepare a paper in article than in book. book is a good choice for books, and for books and papers in general. It provides a better layout than article, but is more complex than article.

What is the difference between \input and \include?

\input and \include are used to get text from a file into a LaTeX document. \input is the preferred command for general use and is generally more robust. \include has some other features, such as the ability to turn off chapter numbering and to start at a

1. Introduction
Coral reefs are considered among the most productive ecosystems in the world, estimated to provide services totaling $10 trillion despite covering only ~0.3% of the ocean floor1. Their evolutionary success relies on the association between coral animals and symbiotic algae. Corals provide shelter and nutrients for symbionts which in turn supply sugars and O to their hosts2. Corals host symbionts within the symbiosome, an intracellular space3 defined by the coral-derived symbiosome membrane. This membrane is thought to allow corals to regulate delivery of nutrients to the symbiont but the specific transport mechanisms are mostly unknown. Alarmingly, human-caused ocean warming, acidification, and eutrophication disrupt this symbiosis leading to the expulsion of symbionts (known as ‘bleaching’

I have already obtained the basic knowledge for conducting the research. In particular, I have cloned the first coral Rh from Acropora yongei (ayRh) (MH025799), developed anti-ayRh antibodies, and confirmed ayRh protein expression via Western Blots. I found that ayRh is more abundant in the symbiosome membrane during daytime compared to the night via immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM) (Figure 1). I will clone the second coral Rh from Stylophora pistillata (spRh), develop anti-spRh antibodies, and confirm spRh protein expression via Western Blots. I will determine the transport and function of ayRh and spRh in vitro and in vivo. I will then characterize coral Rh regulation and responses to stress. My research will contribute to the understanding of coral

Westra, and Lucian Ciortuz.} The Curent OpenReview system (Curent) is a peer-review platform for open science. The system is meant to improve the peer-review process in various ways, for instance, by providing the reviewers with access to the raw data, by removing the need for non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), and by providing the authors with access to the raw reviews that are received for their submissions. Curent is currently used by a small number of journals, but it is not clear whether it is suitable for widespread adoption. We present a machine-learning approach that attempts to predict the quality of the Curent peer-review system. We use 1,227 reviews from four different journals as the input for our machine learning experiments. The results show that our

INPUT: The evolution of similar traits in distantly related species is one of nature’s great surprises. Convergent evolution of traits has been widely observed throughout the animal kingdom; however, it is often unclear whether this phenotypic convergence results from convergent evolution of genes (Stern, Nat Rev Genet 2013). On a molecular level, convergent evolution occurs when the amino acids of a specific protein preferentially undergo mutations that produce similar or even identical amino acid sequences within distinct evolutionary lineages. A high level of adaptive convergent evolution – that is, convergence due to positive selection of beneficial mutations – would suggest that some genes have “optimal configurations

DIAGNOSIS: I predict that convergent molecular evolution occurs at a higher rate than has been previously observed, and that this genetic convergence drives convergence of observable traits. To test for molecular convergence, I have developed a novel computational framework. I will apply this framework to 61 sequenced mammalian genomes to identify genes that have evolved in convergence. I will focus on genes that may be responsible for specific phenotypic convergences, such as adaptation to high

Aim 1: Develop a novel computational framework for identifying convergent evolution between genomes. My framework will be generalizable to any data set with the following inputs: 1) a phylogenetic tree for a set of species, and 2) the pairwise sequence alignments of all proteins in those species. I will limit my analysis to genes unambiguously alignable to a one-to- one human ortholog in at least 80% of mammalian genomes. I have verified that even after filtering on these criteria,>50% of all human genes are retained. My analysis will integrate these data as follows:  Step 1: Infer ancestral sequences. For every amino acid in every sequence, I will compute amino acid sequences at each ancestral node in the phylogeny using the linear-time maximum parsimony method implemented in PAML 4 (Yang, Mol Biol Evol 2007).  Step 2: Infer patterns of adaptive convergent evolution between species

Convergent evolution of traits has been widely observed throughout the animal kingdom; however, it is often unclear whether this phenotypic convergence results from convergent evolution of genes (Stern, Nat Rev Genet 2013). On a molecular level, convergent evolution occurs when the amino acids of a specific protein preferentially undergo mutations that produce similar or even identical amino acid sequences within distinct evolutionary lineages. A high level of adaptive convergent evolution – that is, convergence due to positive selection of beneficial mutations – would suggest that some genes have “optimal configurations,” which evolution uses and reuses across species. If such genes exist, then evolution is somewhat predictable, proceeding by one of a small number of possible paths (Stern & Orgogozo, Science 2008). In contrast, a complete absence of adaptive convergence would indicate that protein configurations beneficial to one species are seldom optimal within

For the first time, we will be able to identify the genes whose mutations frequently evolve in convergence, and to explore the functional roles of these genes in the context of both convergent phenotypes and convergent genotypes. 3. The convergence framework is a generalizable method and can be extended to other data, including  whole-genome sequences of other organisms.

MsrA is responsible for the reduction of methionine sulfoxide residues to the corresponding methionine, a key step in the repair of oxidatively damaged proteins. Methionine sulfoxide reductase B (MsrB) is a bacterial enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the reduction of methionine sulfoxide to methionine. In mammals, the MsrA enzyme is responsible for the reduction of methionine sulfoxides in proteins. We propose that the full functionality of MsrA requires a methylthiolation of the enzyme catalytic cysteine prior to the reduction of methionine sulfoxide residues. We have established that the FMO3 enzyme is responsible for this methylthiolation of the active site cyst

Conventional LIB electrolytes are aqueous or organic solvents with high dielectric constants (greater than 20). These solvents are limited by high resistance and swelling of the electrodes. The novel ionic liquid electrolyte with low dielectric constant is added to the LIB to provide a low resistance path for Li-ion transport while maintaining ionic conductivity.

This cancer is characterized by the overproduction of epithelial ovarian cells, which can spread to other parts of the body and form tumors. In 2013 alone, approximately 22,000 new cases of ovarian cancer were reported and 14,000 women were expected to die from the disease (1). Currently, there are two main types of chemotherapies used for ovarian cancer: platinum-based drugs, which are used to treat ovarian cancer in early stages, and taxanes, which are used to treat advanced ovarian cancer (2). These drugs are administered intravenously and are used to kill cancer cells by inhibiting DNA synthesis. Unfortunately, many ovarian cancer patients develop resistance to these drugs, causing

Reasoning Process: Peptidines will have characteristic secondary structures similar to those found in peptides, although their secondary structures will be more rigid than peptoids and peptides due to their higher functional density (peptidines are expected to have a more rigid structure). In addition, peptidine structure will vary with changes in pH, temperature and solvent, but by varying computationally the degree of steric hindrance on each side chain I will be able to control peptidine folding patterns in different chemical environments and thus control their function and selectivity once synthesized.

@p4r4d0x I think you are understating the problem. While there are a variety of ways to solve this problem, the approach I took was to simplify the problem by focusing on the distinction between Winner and Honorable Mention. I think this is the first step in any problem, determine the classes you wish to predict.

Catalyst Design and Evaluation for Selective Hydrogenation of Biomass-Derived Furans

1. Problem Statement A key economic challenge of renewable fuels is the production of renewable chemicals. The direct conversion of biomass-derived carbohydrates into fuels and chemicals is an attractive option but is currently inhibited by the difficulty of selectively hydrogenating the biomass-derived furan derivatives because of the presence of other oxygenated functional groups (e.g., aldehydes and ketones). Hydrogenation of these highly oxygenated compounds can lead to the formation of undesirable by-products such as HMF, acetone, and formic acid. For example, acetone is an important industrial chemical and can be used to produce acrylonitrile and acrylamide (a precursor to the

I am also trying to solve this problem.

I am not sure if this is the best way to do it. I am using a bag of words for each clinical note

But I am getting a very low accuracy for the training set (around 30%), and I think that is due to the bag of words representation.

My model is a simple random forest for now.

I would appreciate any help that you could give me. Thank you

Dear [Senator or Representative’s Name],

I am writing to you today because I am concerned about President Trump's budget request for Fiscal Year 2020, which would cut more than a billion dollars in funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the Department of Education.

In recent years, the NIH has proven to be a powerful driver of innovation, economic growth and job creation, and continues to make significant investments in biomedical research to address major problems in health care. The National Science Foundation is responsible for funding the nation's most fundamental scientific research, which acts as the foundation for scientific discovery and innovation. The Department of Education supports research that is vital to our nation's economic competitiveness and supports education programs that are critical to student success and economic mobility.

I urge you to support increased funding for these important programs in FY 2020, which

The Internet of Things (IoT) is an ecosystem of physical objects that are embedded with sensors, electronics, software, and connectivity in order to collect and exchange data. In the tourism industry, the IoT allows businesses to collect data about visitors, and then use the data to provide services that meet and even exceed customer expectations. There are many opportunities for research on the IoT and tourism, since the IoT has already made an impact on many areas of tourism such as hospitality, attractions, transportation, and event management. However, most of the work on the IoT and tourism is descriptive and does not provide a strong theoretical foundation. This paper employs a literature review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) flow diagram. This review revealed that much of the research in this area is in the conceptual stage, which provides an

D. E. Kerns is a Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley, in the School of Information, with research interests in data science and social science. She currently works with the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences (BITSS) and the Open Science Collaboration to help increase research transparency and reproducibility in the social sciences.

Crucial to the success of any scientific enterprise is the ability to replicate and extend past research. Yet replication rates for social science studies are alarmingly low: only 36% of studies in psychology and 11% in economics are successfully replicated[1]. A lack of reproducibility can be due to any number of factors, but in the case of social science it is often the result of a lack of standardization, or of the failure to adhere to previously published guidance. Here I propose
